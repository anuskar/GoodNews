        "title": "Giving up on US, Haitian migrants opt for 'Mexican dream'",
        "body": "It wasn't his first choice, but Mexico is now home for Evens Luxama -- along with thousands of other Haitians forced to put their hopes of migrating to the United States on hold.\n\nThe 34-year-old is one of a growing number of people from the crisis-torn Caribbean nation pursuing what activists have described as the \"Mexican dream,\" building a life in a land that migrants traditionally hurried through.\n\n\"I wanted to go to the United States, but I don't think there's another country that offers the opportunity that Mexico does right now,\" said Luxama, who hopes his partner and young daughter will join him in the Mexican capital soon.\n\n\"In Mexico, they accept you, not only Haitians, but all foreigners,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"They do everything to get you regularized, so that you have your papers, and with your papers, you can bring your family to live with you,\" he said.\n\nHaiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, has seen years of worsening security due to raging gang violence, with its political, economic and public health systems also in tatters.\n\nLuxama fled overseas last year after a gang kidnapped a cousin and the sister of his girlfriend, who were released after paying a ransom.\n\nAt the time, the Mexican embassy was the only one open in Port-au-Prince to process his visa request.\n\nLuxama now works in Mexico City as an editor at a video production company -- one of an unprecedented 141,000 people who sought refuge in the Latin American nation in 2023, mostly from Haiti, Honduras and Cuba.\n\nIn a recent video call to his parents in Haiti, he asked about the situation back home.\n\n\"You already know, son -- a lot of problems,\" his father replied.\n\nHaiti has spiraled deeper into chaos since president Jovenel Moise was assassinated in 2021.\n\nGangs run rampant in large swaths of the country, and homicides in Haiti more than doubled last year to nearly 4,800, according to a UN report released last month.\n\nIn October, the United Nations Security Council authorized the deployment of a multinational force to help restore order.\n\n\"It's almost impossible to live in Haiti,\" said Luxama, who fears that he will be powerless to help his family when danger comes.\n\n- 'Mexican dream exists' -\n\nMigration from Haiti is not a new phenomenon for Mexico.\n\nIn September 2021, after a deadly earthquake in their country, thousands of Haitian migrants crowded into the Mexican border city of Ciudad Acuna hoping to cross over to the United States.\n\nThere were already Haitian communities in Tijuana on the Mexican-US border and the southern city of Tapachula, where thousands gathered seeking permits to travel through Mexico to the United States.\n\nThese days, Haitians are also a growing presence in Mexico City, many of them working in low-paid, informal jobs.\n\nSome sleep on the streets in makeshift camps.\n\nRule changes and the \"militarization\" of the southern US border are among the reasons prompting migrants to stay in Mexico, said Rafael Velasquez, country director at the humanitarian group International Rescue Committee.\n\n\"Many people arrive and when they see that there is an opportunity (in Mexico), that the Mexican dream exists, they decide to give it a try,\" he said.\n\nAlthough the United States is allowing thousands of Haitians with expired travel documents to stay on, it only applies to those who arrived before November 6, 2022.\n\nOn a street in the Mexican capital, five Haitians drilled the pavement to install pipes near an abandoned cinema.\n\nOne of them, who gave his name as Jony and speaks Spanish, acts as an interpreter between the bosses and the rest of the workers, who speak Haitian Creole.\n\nHe was part of a wave of Haitians who arrived in Brazil after a devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010 that left more than 300,000 people dead.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, many of them headed north from Brazil as well as Chile, citing discrimination and difficulty obtaining legal status, according to New York-based Human Rights Watch.\n\nEvery day, Jony travels several hours by subway to and from his workplace, and sometimes spends days waiting to be paid his salary.\n\nAlthough he originally wanted to go to the United States, he said he stayed in Mexico because \"it's easier to return to Haiti one day.\"",

        "title": "Ukraine on the defensive as Russia war enters third year",
        "body": "Ukraine on Saturday marked two years since Russia's invasion, entering a new year of war weakened by a lack of western aid while Russia is emboldened by fresh gains.\n\nWhen Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" at dawn on February 24, 2022, many expected Moscow's victory within days, but Ukraine fought back, forcing Russian troops into humiliating retreats.\n\nBut Ukraine has suffered setbacks with the failure of its 2023 counteroffensive. The Russian army has in turn built up a position of strength thanks to booming war production, while Ukraine's troops are short of manpower and running low on Western-supplied ammunition for artillery and air defences.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that decisions on arms supplies have to be \"the priority\".\n\nSaturday's anniversary will see visits by Western leaders including EU commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, but the overall picture remains bleak for Kyiv due to the US Congress blocking a vital $60 billion aid package. This has come on top of delays in promised European deliveries.\n\nUS President Joe Biden renewed calls for Republican lawmakers to unblock the additional funding, warning that \"history is waiting\" and \"failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will not be forgotten\".\n\n- 'War is our life' -\n\nRussia is attacking hard in the east, with the destroyed town of Maryinka near Donetsk the latest hotspot after it captured the heavily fortified town of Avdiivka on February 17.\n\nUkraine's economy has also been hit by a border blockade by Polish farmers that Kyiv says threatens exports and has held up deliveries of weapons.\n\nIn Kyiv, the mood was grim but still defiant as people said they had grown accustomed to wartime conditions.\n\n\"For women of Ukraine, this is our heartache -- for our husbands, for our children, for our fathers,\" said nutritionist Olga Byrko in Kyiv.\n\n\"I would really like this to end as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"Yes of course we have learned to live with it... now the war is our life,\" said Yuriy Pasichnyk, a 38-year-old businessman.\n\n\"I think we need to have more weapons so that we can drive this evil spirit out of our land and start rebuilding our Ukraine,\" said 51-year-old Kostyantyn Gofman.\n\nUkraine needs almost half a trillion dollars to rebuild towns and cities destroyed by Russia's invasion, according to the latest estimate by the World Bank, European Union, United Nations and Ukrainian government.\n\nUkraine has estimated that around 50,000 civilians have been killed.\n\n- 'Running out of shells' -\n\nNeither side has given numbers for military deaths and injured, while both claim to have inflicted huge losses.\n\nIn August 2023, The New York Times quoted US officials as putting Ukraine's military losses at 70,000 dead and 100,000 to 120,000 injured.\n\nLeaked US intelligence in December indicated that 315,000 Russian troops had been killed or wounded.\n\nOn the eastern front, morale is low as outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian troops are ceding ground to Russian forces.\n\n\"We are running out of shells and the Russians keep coming. Lots of our comrades are injured -- or worse. Everything is getting worse and worse,\" said one soldier near Bakhmut, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nMoscow has massively ramped up its arms production and received drones from Iran, while Kyiv says it has confirmed Russia's use of North Korean missiles.\n\nZelensky said in December the military wanted to draft up to 500,000 more troops. A bill to broaden mobilisation has caused wide public fear.\n\nThe conflict has thrown Russia into even greater isolation from the West, with the United States and its allies imposing a slew of sanctions.\n\nBut Putin has brushed off the fallout and hailed the troops as \"true national heroes\".\n\nHe has used the war years to rally patriotism and mount an even harsher crackdown on dissent, with few daring to voice opposition to the war.\n\nThe death in prison of opposition leader Alexei Navalny has removed Putin's arch-foe, and he is set to extend his term in office in elections next month.\n\nOn the streets of Moscow, most people told AFP they back the soldiers fighting in Ukraine.\n\n\"I'm proud of our men,\" said 27-year-old Nadezhda, an environmental engineer.\n\n\"Of course I am anxious for them, but it's a pleasant feeling that they are doing great, they are out there fighting for our country.\"\n\nOne of the few to give an alternative opinion, was Konstantin, a drama teacher working as a waiter, who said: \"I'm against any war. Two years have passed and it annoys me that people can't talk to each other and are still at war.\"",

        "body": "Steve Belichick has given fans a little bit of an update on what his father, Bill, might do to keep himself busy this year after being passed on in the latest NFL head coaching hiring cycle.\n\nBill Belichick and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft parted ways after the 2023 season, following a historic 24-year run together that culminated in six Super Bowl championships.\n\nIn a surprise, the legendary head coach wasn't hired in the 2024 HC hiring cycle. In fact, the Atlanta Falcons were the only team to interview Belichick (they did so twice), but they wound up hiring ex-Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris for the position.\n\nSpeaking with former NFLer Chris Long on the \"Green Light\" podcast (h/t Josh Alper of Pro Football Talk), the younger Belichick indicated that his father may look at doing television stuff this upcoming year:\n\n\"I think he's good. Let the stuff roll off your back and move forward. He doesn't dwell, unless we lost a game and he needs to get on some guys. Eventually you need to turn the page. Honestly I wasn't too involved in any of that stuff, he did his thing, I did my thing and that was kind of that. He's definitely pursuing some other stuff, whether it's TV or hopefully a regular on the Green Light or whatever it may be.\n\nHis hobbies would still be to, let's say, critique football. So you know he was excited when I came out here because he got to evaluate the scheme last year, evaluate the players last year. I'm sure he'll come out here at some point to do some stuff. The guy just loves football, so there's definitely that element.\"\n\nSteve also wound up leaving the Patriots to accept the Washington Huskies' defensive coordinator position. His brother, Brian, decided to remain with New England to continue working as the safeties coach under new Patriots HC Jerod Mayo.\n\nThough he's known for being a man of few words with the media, Bill did win a Sports Emmy Award for his excellent analysis and on the NFL's \"100th Anniversary All-Time Team\" program.\n\nNobody knows the game better than Belichick, who would easily flourish on television as an analyst if he decided to go that route.",

        "body": "For Venezuelan Jaimar Tuarez, 22, being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis felt like a death sentence in a country unable to provide the drugs she needs to keep her ever-worsening symptoms at bay.\n\nWith no means of paying for private treatment or tests, including a spinal tap that costs $800, the psychology student has launched a crowd-funding campaign on GoFundMe that she hopes will allow her to travel abroad in search of medical help.\n\n\"For many people the only option is to emigrate,\" Tuarez, who was diagnosed in 2022, told AFP at her apartment in Charallave, a city some 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Caracas.\n\n\"I have to get out of here...\" she said through tears. \"What will happen with my next relapse? Will I lose the ability to speak? I am 22 years old... what will happen to all my dreams, my plans?\"\n\nThe plight of Tuarez and an estimated 2,000 other Venezuelans with MS -- a potentially disabling disease of the central nervous system -- underlines the difficulties facing people in need of chronic medication in cash-strapped Venezuela.\n\nThere is no cure, but drugs can alleviate MS symptoms.\n\nAccording to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IAHCR), Venezuela's IVSS social welfare institute stopped providing prescription MS medication years ago.\n\nVenezuela is in the grips of an unprecedented economic crisis, with its once-thriving oil industry all but collapsed and GDP shrinking by 80 percent in eight years of recession until 2022.\n\nMillions have fled in search of a better life elsewhere, many seeking a path to the United States.\n\n- 'We are adrift -\n\nTuarez has weakened to the point where she can barely stand, forcing her to abandon her psychology studies and quit her job as an online editor that had helped augment the family income.\n\nNow Tuarez and her mother, a stroke survivor, both depend on the meager income of her 72-year-old grandmother, who works at a beauty salon in the capital.\n\nAndres Marcano, a 53-year-old translator diagnosed with MS two decades ago, told AFP his mobility has drastically deteriorated in the last five years after he stopped receiving state-funded medication.\n\n\"I find it difficult to speak. I don't walk. I am unable to stand and therefore I move around in a wheelchair,\" he told AFP via WhatsApp.\n\nThe situation \"is serious, we are adrift,\" said another MS sufferer, Maria Eugenia Monagas, 57, who pays privately for treatment thanks to the income of her husband and two children, one of them abroad.\n\n\"Many are disabled, or dead, due to a lack of medicines,\" she said.\n\nThe government of President Nicolas Maduro blames the state's failure on US sanctions. But others point to graft allegations against officials from the health ministry and the IVSS in a country with a long history of corruption and mismanagement, according to international observers.\n\n- No options -\n\nTuarez said her last relapse left her temporarily unable to speak, walk or eat independently.\n\nShe was prescribed steroids to ease the symptoms, but could not get any through the IVSS.\n\nIn the private sector, the medicines she needs cost as much as $30,000 per year.\n\nTuarez said she spent Christmas Eve sending out emails to aid organizations in different countries, seeking help to leave the country with her mother, who needs care and cannot be left behind.\n\nSo far, she has collected $600 out of her objective of $10,000.\n\nTuarez is overwhelmed at the thought of leaving behind her family, a beloved dog and two cats, but fears her life is in danger if she does not.\n\n\"I wish there were other options, to make a career and live my life (in Venezuela), but there are none,\" Tuarez said.",

        "body": "Wendy Williams had fans concerned for years over her health and wellbeing, but it looks like they should be worried about her finances, too. Amid the news that the former talk show host is battling dementia and aphasia, concerned supporters want to know more about her money and if Wendy is actually broke.\n\nIs Wendy Williams Broke?\n\nIn a manner of speaking, yes. Wendy is said to have a net worth of $500,000, according to Celebrity Net Worth, as of February 2024. This may sound like a fair amount of money, but Wendy had a net worth of $40 million in 2020 and was making $55,000 per episode of The Wendy Williams Show.\n\nWhat Happened to Wendy Williams' Money?\n\nWendy enjoyed 13 seasons of The Wendy Williams Show, her stardom significantly boosting her income. However, the last arc of the show was clouded in controversy, as Wendy's health and suspected addiction were said to be deciding factors in her departure from the hosting couch.\n\nThe Wendy Williams Show ended in June 2022, and by October 2022, Wendy's team confirmed that she had entered rehab. Not only this, but she was placed under a financial guardianship after a New York judge placed an authority over her money, the result of a dispute between her and Wells Fargo.\n\nLa'Shawn Thomas, Wendy's attorney, alleged that the talk show host had petitioned the bank to help her access her account information and statements, as there was suspicion that there was misconduct on behalf of her financial advisor. However, Wells Fargo didn't budge, and instead petitioned to have a guardian placed over Wendy's accounts as she was an \"incapacitated person\" and a \"victim of undue influence and financial exploitation.\"\n\nThomas later told The Hollywood Reporter, \"Wendy doesn't agree with a financial guardian being appointed. If it's the court's intention to have one appointed over her affairs for the long haul, she definitely isn't going to accept that.\"\n\nAfter much time, it was reported by multiple outlets that the guardian in question is Sabrina Morrissey, an attorney and guardianship professional.\n\n\"I have no money,\" Wendy said, indicating that she still does not have access to her finances. \"And let me tell you something. If it happens to me, it can happen to you.\"\n\nHer words were a sharp departure from her admission to the New York Post in 2022, where she recounted watching the finale of her show - hosted by Sherri Shepherd - in her apartment.\n\n\"Maybe I'll go back on TV. Perhaps, I don't know,\" Wendy said at the time. \"I've got so much money, I can do anything I want or nothing at all.\"",

        "title": "Eagles' A.J. Brown says 'I want to be here' and has no issues with Jalen Hurts",
        "body": "By EJ Smith, The Philadelphia Inquirer The Tribune Content Agency\n\nPHILADELPHIA - A.J. Brown wanted to set the record straight.\n\nThe Eagles star wide receiver called into 94.1 WIP Friday afternoon to address discussions surrounding him on the station and elsewhere earlier in the week. In a 15-minute interview live on air, Brown refuted the notion that he's unhappy on the Eagles or that he and quarterback Jalen Hurts have a tenuous relationship following the team's collapse last season.\n\n\"I think that's sort of B.S. I'm not going to get into me and his relationship on the air, but it's total B.S.,\" Brown said. \"It wasn't a problem when I was on my six-game streak. They weren't talking about that then, but they're talking about it when we're losing.\"\n\nBrown said the team's 1-6 finish to last season, a stretch that led to significant overhaul to the coaching staff, came down to players not executing. He rebutted the suggestion from one host that the Eagles were playing \"like the best team in the league\" while winning 10 of their first 11 games, pointing to the team \"scratching it out\" against lesser opponents during that stretch.\n\nWhen asked about Hurts' personality and reporting in The Philadelphia Inquirer about members in the Eagles organization wanting Hurts to open up more and be more available to his teammates during difficult times, Brown said he didn't want the quarterback to change.\n\n\"Jalen is himself,\" Brown said. \"I don't agree or disagree, he's going to be himself, and I'm not the person to try and paint him to be something that he's not or whatever the case may be. But when things were going good, you didn't hear those reports. The season pulled everybody every which way. There were ups and downs and more downs than ups. But when we were winning, you saw the same reaction from him on the sideline.\n\n\"But when we were losing, you still saw the same reaction, so how can you get upset at the same person for doing the same thing? A couple months ago, he was the greatest leader for this organization. So I don't agree or disagree. He's going to be himself and I want him to be nobody but himself.\"\n\nSimilar to the way he broke his media silence during the season, Brown foreshadowed his call to the radio station with a post to X, formerly known as Twitter, the day before. Brown said his account was hijacked during the Super Bowl and the impersonator sent several posts, but that he regained control of it before addressing the station's social media account late Thursday night.\n\nBrown said he called in to \"stand up to the bully\" and said he feels misunderstood by some fans and media members, claiming he is unfairly compared to Hall of Fame receiver Terrell Owens' dramatic tenure with the Eagles.\n\n\"The stigma between what T.O. did here, they always want to pinpoint that,\" he said. \"They just put me in this bubble with him and whatever he did in the past. And I know him, he's a great person, I don't want to speak badly, but I'm my own person. I don't move like that. I don't do any of that stuff with any of my teammates. That's the reason I'm on this show today. I'm the person who stands up to the bully.\"\n\nBrown also disputed claims that he wants to be traded from the Eagles when asked about his feelings being on the team. The station discussed whether he should be traded earlier this year.\n\n\"Why would someone think I wasn't even happy?\" Brown said. \"I want to be here. It's as simple as that. I love where I'm at, it's simple as that, next question.\"",

        "body": "AT&T customers woke up Thursday morning with no internet service. Reports delivered to Downdetector.com showed tens of thousands of AT&T customers had no cell service on their mobile devices.\n\nOver X (formerly Twitter), AT&T initially reported the outages were due to planned maintenance on its network. Later in the morning AT&T said they were aware of the problem and were working to restore coverage.\n\nBy 3 p.m. Eastern time AT&T reported that service had been restored to all of its affected customers.\n\nThese outages can happen when there's a problem with the network as a whole or when the cellular provider is updating the network or the cell towers. All cellular companies have had outages for one reason or another.\n\nYou'll know your network is down when you see SOS at the top of the screen. If you're a car, you won't be able to stream music from Spotify or use GPS navigation apps like Waze. You should be able to make 9-1-1 calls. Cellular companies are required to provide emergency services on all phones regardless of connectivity. They do this by working with the other providers.\n\nCellular companies share space on cell towers. So when a 911 call cannot be placed on one network, another network makes the connection. There some call centers reported that 9-1-1 calls were not getting through. The FCC will investigate why that happened.\n\nDespite thousands of reports on DownDectector.com, Verizon and T-Mobile say their networks were not affected and suspect those outage reports were from customers trying to call people with AT&T phones.\n\nIf your service goes down, your phone will connect to the internet if you're on WiFi. And, if you make one change in settings, calls and texts will go through.\n\nIn settings under cellular, turn on \"Wi-Fi\" calling. When a wifi signal is stronger than a cell signal, the call will be placed over the internet. But, you'll need to change this setting when you have a cellular network signal. You may not be able to change the setting in SOS mode.\n\nIt's important to make the changes before there's an outage. Because all of the providers have had issues in the past, and all will likely have outages from time to time.",

        "body": "By Cole Thompson Sports Illustrated Texas Rangers News, Analysis and More\n\nCody Bradford would be the first to admit his spring training appearance was far from what he expected.\n\nThe breaking ball wasn't breaking. A few two-strike pitches just fell outside the line. A run crossed home during his two innings of work for the Texas Rangers in a 5-4 win Friday afternoon in Surprise, Ariz.\n\nFor now, it's fine. One spring training appearance won't define Bradford's season once the team returns to Arlington. But Bradford is taking his time on the mound with a stern approach over the next few weeks before the Rangers welcome the Chicago Cubs on Opening Day.\n\n\"For me it's just getting command,\" said Bradford. \"I just need to make sure I can locate the fastball well, throw the changeup in there when I need to and then get ahead with the breaking ball.\"\n\nBradford needed two pitches to set himself up with a short inning. He needed three to give Kansas City an early 1-0 lead off a Drew Waters' solo shot to left-center field.\n\nBoth of Bradford's outs came on fastballs. The homer was on a change-up, the same pitch that was fouled off before to set up a 1-1 count.\n\n\"Whenever you throw a really good pitch you try to make the next one a little bit nastier, but I ended up hanging it right down the middle,\" said Bradford. \"[Waters] got a hold of it. It was a really good swing.\"\n\nBradford said he went 1-of-3 on the breaking pitches Friday. Is it a win? Perhaps down the line, but Bradford's attention for now is trying to land something to loosen up the heater.\n\n\"Just something I could land for strikes,\" said Bradford. \"Not necessarily a swing-and-miss, just looking to get ahead in the count.\"\n\nAfter the long ball, Bradford gave up a single before retiring four in a row to end his afternoon with a 3-1 lead. Among the eight batters faced, Bradford never fell behind in the count.\n\nTexas returns to the field Saturday for a 3:05 p.m. CT first pitch against the Royals.\n\nRelated: Who Did What In Texas Rangers Spring Training Opener?\n\nCatch up with Inside the Rangers on Facebook andX.\n\nCopyright ABG-SI LLC.

        "body": "February's full moon, known as the snow moon, is set to peak on Saturday, shining bright around the world in the night sky.Related video above: Full moons: When are they and what are their names?The moon will be at its most full at 7:30 a.m. ET Saturday, according to EarthSky, but to the human eye, the moon will appear full for a couple of days, so the best time to view it will be the nights before and after its peak.While called the snow moon, the golden orb will look almost like any ordinary full moon. But this moon will be a micromoon, meaning it might look slightly smaller than usual.\"It's just a little bit farther away from Earth than (the moon) typically is,\" said Rachel Klima, a planetary geologist and lunar expert with Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.\"It's about 10% smaller. So it may look a little bit smaller. But a lot of the time, when people see a really huge moon, it's usually because it's low on the horizon, rather than because of the actual distance of it,\" Klima said. \"(The micromoon) won't be super, super tiny. It'll just be a little bit smaller than your average full moon that you look up at.\"The full moon phase occurs when the moon, Earth and the sun are in alignment, in that order. February's full moon will occur when the moon is at its farthest point from Earth in its elliptical orbit, known as the apogee, Klima said. The micromoon will also be dimmer than the moon typically looks by about 30%, according to EarthSky, allowing for slightly better visibility of nearby celestial objects, without the average luminous interference.This year, the snow moon will shine next to the constellation Leo's brightest star, Regulus. Near the moon's peak, on the night of Feb. 23, the star will be seen just below the orb, according to EarthSky.You obviously don't need any special equipment to enjoy moon-gazing, but binoculars can be a good tool for those looking to see its features and craters clearly, Klima said. While full moons are best observed in clear skies, even in slightly cloudy weather the moon will occasionally peek through the clouds, she added.Lunar explorationOn Thursday, the Odysseus lunar lander successfully soft-landed near the moon's south pole, accomplishing a feat that had not been attempted by any vehicle launched from the United States since the Apollo program ended more than five decades ago. Intuitive Machines' IM-1 mission also marked the first commercial spacecraft to soft-land on the moon amid a renewed international dash for the lunar surface.\"The nice thing to kind of dream about when you look up at the moon right now is how much renewed activity there is internationally,\" Klima said. \"We're basically opening up a new era of lunar exploration. ... As these different companies start to land on the moon, we're going to be able to learn much, much more and really have this whole new world -- economic world and scientific world -- opened up to us.\"More full moons this yearOf the 12 full moons in 2024, February's full moon is the only micromoon of the year, while the September and October lunar events will be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky.Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger and brighter in the night sky. Some astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee -- its closest approach to Earth in orbit.Here are the remaining full moons of 2024:March 25: Worm moon April 23: Pink moon May 23: Flower moon June 21: Strawberry moon July 21: Buck moon Aug. 19: Sturgeon moon Sept. 17: Harvest moon Oct. 17: Hunter's moon Nov. 15: Beaver moon Dec. 15: Cold moon Solar and lunar eclipsesMultiple eclipses will occur in 2024.The most highly anticipated of these events is the total solar eclipse on April 8, which will be visible in parts of Mexico, the United States and Canada. A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, completely blocking the sun's face.Those within the path of totality, or locations where the moon's shadow will completely cover the sun, will see a total solar eclipse. People outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse in which the moon only obscures part of the sun's face.A total solar eclipse won't be visible across the contiguous United States again until August 2044.An annular solar eclipse will occur on Oct. 2 over parts of South America. This type of eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, except the moon is at the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, so it can't completely block the sun. Instead, annular solar eclipses create a \"ring of fire\" in the sky as the sun's fiery light surrounds the moon's shadow.Meanwhile, a penumbral lunar eclipse will be visible to many across Europe, North and East Asia, Australia, Africa, North America and South America between March 24 and 25.A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when the sun, Earth and moon align so that the moon passes into Earth's shadow. A penumbral lunar eclipse is more subtle and happens when the moon moves through the outer shadow, or penumbra, of Earth.A partial lunar eclipse, in which Earth moves between the sun and the full moon without being perfectly aligned, will appear over Europe and much of Asia, Africa, North America and South America between Sept. 17 and 18.Check Time and Date's website to see when each of these eclipses will appear.Meteor showers of 2024Sky-gazers can look forward to a multitude of meteor showers this year, according to the American Meteor Society.

        "body": "By James Brizuela Sports Illustrated UCLA Bruins News, Analysis and More\n\nDylan Andrews was recently named Pac-12 Player of the Week amid a remarkable stretch for the sophomore point guard. From Jan. 28 to Feb. 4, Andrews averaged 19.5 points, 5.0 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 1.5 steals.\n\nOverall this season, Andrews is leading the team minutes (34.9) and assists per game, and ranks third in points (11.4). It's a remarkable turnaround for a player who was routinely questioned early in the season as to whether he could run an offense after taking over for departed floor general Tyger Campbell.\n\nAs chronicled by Ben Bolch in the Los Angeles Times, Andrews' maturation was more than a case of a young basketball player coming into his own.\n\nOff the court, Andrews was grieving the loss of his grandfather, Jimmy, who died in Aug. 2022. The 2022-23 season was a trying one for the budding star, according to Breeze McDonald, Jimmy Andrews' goddaughter and Dylan Andrews' youth coach:\n\n\"People try to push you through it, like you've just got to get going, like this is your life, but you've lost a whole part of your life, so it took him a minute, yeah. I saw it because I know him, I saw it on the court, I saw it in his focus, it would show up in different odd places, and I had to remind everybody around him that he lost somebody big.\"\n\n-- Breeze McDonald, via the Los Angeles Times\n\nAs Bolch reports, Jimmy Andrews' mentorship has continued to inspire Dylan Andrews this season as he's come into his own. \"Everything I do is for him,\" Andrews told the TImes.\n\nThe Bruins had their six-game winning streak snapped Sunday by Utah. They're 14-12 overall and 9-6 in Pac-12 play coming into Saturday's crosstown rivalry game against USC.",

The program was made possible after receiving money from the state a few years ago, but its future is uncertain and more money's needed for class to stay in session.\n\nSince 2021, the P-TECH program has given hundreds of high schoolers a head start when it comes to college credit and education.\n\n\"I joined P-TECH because I knew I always wanted a career in the nursing pathway, and I felt like P-TECH gave me all the opportunities,\" said ninth grader Amaya James.\n\n\"I've always wanted to do something in the health care field specifically nursing,\" said 9th grader Raml Saiyd.\n\n\"I heard they had an IT program, and I really enjoy working with computers and stuff,\" said 9th grader Jamie Ahern.\n\n\"The core idea of it is that, a student completes four years of high school and two years of higher education, and they get a degree or a credential at the end of that. But the key thing is that, the courses they take in high school are tightly designed to prepare them for whatever career field they are in,\" said Superintendent Dr. Kent Pekel.\n\nFields that are vital in this community especially when it comes to nursing and technology. But changes during last year's legislative session left the Rochester Public School District with less funding for this monumental program.\n\n\"What happened in the last legislative session, frankly without our knowledge, the changed it from funding for Rochester to a competitive grant that could go anywhere,\" said Pekel.\n\nThose changes are pushing school leaders and lawmakers to action with a new bill.\n\n\"The bill really helps to support Rochester to help fund P-TECH as they work to bring in some more private and public partners,\" said Rep. Kim Hicks (DFL-Rochester).\n\nHicks, the lead author of HF 3722, says the Med City has a unique opportunity to be a model for the entire state.\n\n\"But the cool part about it is it allows Rochester to support other districts as they try to expand this amazing program,\" said Hicks.\n\n\"We'll provide people with the training, the tools, and the information, but we need a few years to get our program on solid ground financially to make that happen,\" said Pekel.\n\nStudents hope the program sticks around.\n\n\"It just like this nice community and I really enjoy that,\" said Ahern.\n\n\"It gives more time to have like a thought process to see if I really want to do this,\" said Saiyd.\n\n\"So, I have a single mom and stuff like that, so getting some of these opportunities for free, like, while I'm in high school, is, like, such a step up,\" said James.\n\nThe bill would be asking for just under $800,000 in funding.

        "title": "OU Baseball: Oklahoma Opens Home Season by Crushing Wright State",
        "body": "By John E. Hoover Sports Illustrated Oklahoma Sooners News, Analysis and More\n\n]Oklahoma's bats exploded, and the Sooners got a dominant start on the mound.\n\nThat was the right combination for an OU rout on Friday at L. Dale Mitchell Park as Oklahoma opened its home schedule by pounding Wright State 20-0 in Norman.\n\nThe Sooners improved to 3-2 on the season, while Wright State fell to 1-3.\n\nLeft-hander Braden Davis pitched six shutout innings and allowed only three hits and a walk while striking out eight of the 23 batters he faced. He threw 92 pitches, including 55 strikes, and lowered his season ERA to 0.82.\n\nDavis had plenty of support at the plate as the Sooners racked up a season-high 21 hits.\n\nSnyder's sacrifice fly to right center brought home Spikerman for a 7-0 lead in the fourth, but the Sooners were only getting started.\n\nSix runs came across in the fifth, starting with Spikerman's two-run single to right that scored Mudler and Pettis for a 9-0 lead. Easton Carmichael's double to left allowed Spikerman to score for a 10-0 lead, and Snyder's double to right moved Carmichael to third and scored Madron to put the Sooners up 11-0. Nicklaus' double to left sent Carmichael home for a 12-0 lead, and Mackenzie made it 13-0 with an RBI groundout that scored Snyder.\n\nOU added four in the seventh when Dasan Harris bounced a two-out grounder on the infield -- his first collegiate hit -- and drove home Carter Frederick to make it 14-0. Mudler then ran it up with a three-run home run to right field for a 17-0 lead.\n\nAfter Wright State left hander Joey Valentine walked the bases loaded in the eighth, Isaiah Lane delivered his first collegiate hit with a three-run triple off the right field wall for a 20-0 lead. It was OU's first 20-spot since 2022.\n\nSpikerman went 3-for-3 with two RBIs and three runs scored, while Mudler was 3-for-5 with three RBIs and three runs and Madron was 2-for-4 with three RBIs and three runs. Snyder was 3-for-4 with three RBIs and a run scored, and Nicklaus had two hits and two RBIs. Pettis had two hits and two runs, Lane had three RBIs and Mackenzie had two RBIs. Only one OU starter didn't record a hit.\n\nJett Lodes relieved Davis and recorded four strikeouts in a scoreless seventh and eighth.\n\nMyles Meyer pitched the ninth and added a strikeout, giving the Sooners at least 13 strikeouts in each of their first five games, but Meyer also gave up a double and two walks to load the bases before Brad Pruett closed things out with another pair of strikeouts, their 15th.\n\nFriday's blowout was the first of a four-game series. The team meet again on Saturday with a 1 p.m. doubleheader, then finish the series at 2 p.m. Sunday. All games can be seen on ESPN+.",

But this moon will be a micromoon, meaning it might look slightly smaller than usual.\n\n\"It's just a little bit farther away from Earth than (the moon) typically is,\" said Rachel Klima, a planetary geologist and lunar expert with Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.\n\n\"It's about 10% smaller. So it may look a little bit smaller. But a lot of the time, when people see a really huge moon, it's usually because it's low on the horizon, rather than because of the actual distance of it,\" Klima said. \"(The micromoon) won't be super, super tiny. It'll just be a little bit smaller than your average full moon that you look up at.\"\n\nThe full moon phase occurs when the moon, Earth and the sun are in alignment, in that order. February's full moon will occur when the moon is at its farthest point from Earth in its elliptical orbit, known as the apogee, Klima said. The micromoon will also be dimmer than the moon typically looks by about 30%, according to EarthSky, allowing for slightly better visibility of nearby celestial objects, without the average luminous interference.\n\nThis year, the snow moon will shine next to the constellation Leo's brightest star, Regulus. Near the moon's peak, on the night of Feb. 23, the star will be seen just below the orb, according to EarthSky.\n\nYou obviously don't need any special equipment to enjoy moon-gazing, but binoculars can be a good tool for those looking to see its features and craters clearly, Klima said. While full moons are best observed in clear skies, even in slightly cloudy weather the moon will occasionally peek through the clouds, she added.\n\nLunar exploration\n\nOn Thursday, the Odysseus lunar lander successfully soft-landed near the moon's south pole, accomplishing a feat that had not been attempted by any vehicle launched from the United States since the Apollo program ended more than five decades ago. Intuitive Machines' IM-1 mission also marked the first commercial spacecraft to soft-land on the moon amid a renewed international dash for the lunar surface.\n\n\"The nice thing to kind of dream about when you look up at the moon right now is how much renewed activity there is internationally,\" Klima said. \"We're basically opening up a new era of lunar exploration. ... As these different companies start to land on the moon, we're going to be able to learn much, much more and really have this whole new world -- economic world and scientific world -- opened up to us.\"\n\nMore full moons this year\n\nOf the 12 full moons in 2024, February's full moon is the only micromoon of the year, while the September and October lunar events will be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky.\n\nDefinitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger and brighter in the night sky. Some astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee -- its closest approach to Earth in orbit.\n\nThe most highly anticipated of these events is the total solar eclipse on April 8, which will be visible in parts of Mexico, the United States and Canada. A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, completely blocking the sun's face.\n\nThose within the path of totality, or locations where the moon's shadow will completely cover the sun, will see a total solar eclipse. People outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse in which the moon only obscures part of the sun's face.\n\nA total solar eclipse won't be visible across the contiguous United States again until August 2044.\n\nAn annular solar eclipse will occur on Oct. 2 over parts of South America. This type of eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, except the moon is at the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, so it can't completely block the sun. Instead, annular solar eclipses create a \"ring of fire\" in the sky as the sun's fiery light surrounds the moon's shadow.\n\nMeanwhile, a penumbral lunar eclipse will be visible to many across Europe, North and East Asia, Australia, Africa, North America and South America between March 24 and 25.\n\nA lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when the sun, Earth and moon align so that the moon passes into Earth's shadow. A penumbral lunar eclipse is more subtle and happens when the moon moves through the outer shadow, or penumbra, of Earth.\n\nA partial lunar eclipse, in which Earth moves between the sun and the full moon without being perfectly aligned, will appear over Europe and much of Asia, Africa, North America and South America between Sept. 17 and 18.\n\nSky-gazers can look forward to a multitude of meteor showers this year, according to the American Meteor Society.

        "title": "Jason Kelce Gives Update on Possible Retirement From NFL",
        "body": "Rumors began swirling about the Philadelphia Eagles center's retirement decision in January. Although reports emerged after the Eagles' season-ending game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that he told his teammates he was leaving the game, the NFL player later walked those rumors back, telling fans he hadn't yet made a decision.\n\nIn the weeks since, the father-of-three watched his younger brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, advance with his team to play in-and ultimately win-Super Bowl LVIII. The game came one year after the Kelce brothers played each other in the 2023 Super Bowl, a game the Chiefs also won.\n\nRelated: Kylie Kelce Shares Plans for Husband Jason's 'New Hobbies' After NFL Retirement\n\nDuring their podcast recording earlier this week, Carvey described reading about the \"adrenaline rush\" and \"camaraderie\" that come with being a professional football player. When Jason decides to retire, Carvey said he should consider exploring work in show business, which he described as an \"emotionally violent sport.\" Carvey suggested the intensity of show business was thus comparable to that of football.\n\nCarvey then asked Jason if he has made a decision about his NFL retirement.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Jason said. \"I'm trying to figure it out right now.\"\n\nThe Eagles center told the comedians that he is currently \"exploring different opportunities\" for when he does decide to retire. But just in case he chooses to return to the Eagles for another season, Jason said he is \"still working out and staying in shape.\"\n\nIn a separate conversation released on Feb. 21 on New Heights, the podcast Jason and Travis host together, Jason discussed retirement with two of his former teammates, Beau Allen and Chris Long, who are both now retired. Allen warned Jason that life can be \"a little boring\" without the \"intensity of football,\" a shift that has, for him, been \"an adjustment.\" Football players grow used to the routines and structures that come with being on a team, Allen said, as well as the bonds they develop with their teammates.\n\n\"It's a huge existential crisis, man,\" Long added. \"Whether you think you're ready or not, your life changes.\"\n\nNext: How the Chiefs-Bills Game Inspired New Retirement Plans for Travis and Jason Kelce\n\nCopyright 2024 The Arena Group, Inc.

        "body": "One day after her team revealed her diagnosis with primary progressive aphasia and dementia, Wendy Williams has broken her silence on the matter.\n\n\"I want to say I have immense gratitude for the love and kind words I have received after sharing my diagnosis of Aphasia and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Let me say, wow! Your response has been overwhelming,\" the former talk show host, 59, wrote in a Friday, February 23, statement. \"The messages shared with me have touched me, reminding me of the power of unity and the need for compassion.\"\n\nThe Wendy Williams Show host carried on in the statement, advocating for those whose stories and experiences with FTD have gone unnoticed.\n\n\"I want to also thank the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration for their kind words of support and their extraordinary efforts to raise awareness of FTD,\" Wendy concluded.\n\nFans no doubt are happy to hear from Wendy, who has remained largely out of the public eye amid ongoing health issues. Her swift departure from The Wendy Williams Show in 2021 - to be replaced by guest hosts and later Sherri Shepherd - came as a surprise, and the show came to a complete end in 2022. The following year, Wendy was given the news about her diagnosis.\n\n\"On behalf of Wendy Williams Hunter, her care team is sharing this very personal update with her cherished fans, friends, and supporters to correct inaccurate and hurtful rumors about her health,\" the initial statement regarding Wendy's health read, released on Thursday, February 22. \"As Wendy's fans are aware, in the past she has been open with the public about her medical struggles with Graves' Disease and Lymphedema as well as other significant challenges related to her health.\"\n\nThe statement confirmed that Wendy did in fact receive the news of her primary progressive aphasia and dementia diagnosis last year. It continued, \"Over the past few years, questions have been raised at times about Wendy's ability to process information and many have speculated about Wendy's condition, particularly when she began to lose words, act erratically at times, and have difficulty understanding financial transactions. Receiving a diagnosis has enabled Wendy to receive the medical care she requires.\"",

I got a tongue piercing and 2 dermals that are healing amazing!\" she captioned the post. \"I'm very grateful for those who could be with me on this special week c: Thank you everyone for the birthday gifts and wishes!! Much love to you all.\"\n\nSophia, 15, shared a series of photos in the carousel, including a snapshot of her new tongue piercing and two dermal piercings. The teen also shared moments of her birthday dinner at Ling Kitchen, where she celebrated with an all-black cake. The dessert matched the black bouquet of roses surrounded by two dollar bills that Sophia received.\n\nWhile some people wished Sophia a happy birthday in the comment section, others shared their disapproval of her body accessory gifts.\n\n\"So sad you can't see her beautiful face at the age 15 she shouldn't have any piercing or any makeup at all I don't know what her mother is thinking her mother and her niece help,\" one person wrote.\n\nOthers, however, didn't allow the negative chatter to consume the post.\n\n\"It's really awesome to see someone so young with the confidence to be herself in the public eye,\" another person commented. \"Happy birthday. I really hope you keep the confidence throughout life.\"\n\nLast year, Sophia got six piercings for her 14th birthday - including a snakebite piercing. Although Farrah, 32, was slammed for allowing her daughter to get a big amount of body art, the reality star blocked out the noise.\n\n\"I won't be shaming my daughter, I LOVE and support Sophia 100 percent on who and what she wants to become,\" Farrah exclusively told In Touch in February 2023. \"The mom shamers should recognize what some kids will grow out of and what they [will not]. That's part of a teen journey as I don't have my belly button piercing anymore.\"\n\nThe Teen Mom alum opened up about her painting style with In Touch in September 2022.\n\n\"I'm happy that Sophia has her nose piercing and she's definitely taken over the internet with it. There's been a lot of other 13-year-olds getting nose piercings,\" Farrah exclusively told In Touch at the time alongside her daughter. \"If it's not permanent and if it's legal, I support it and I would be there.

In-fact, the wife and I finally saw Finding Dory the other night ;) and if you search by theme and by 'most popular' under say ... the Drama category for example, they are pretty sound with such titles as: Braveheart, Filth (which was crazy, but so good), Usual Suspects and Good Will Hunting and more, but it just seems to me that for every good to decent movie you will find, they have 6 or 7 that are just really weak. And don't get me started on their Sci-Fi/Fantasy selection. ;-). I just find, personally, for me, if I want to watch a good movie, it is better to start my search with HBOgo or even Hulu. But tastes are of course very individual. :-)\n\nStill, you can't beat Netflix for the great television shows that you find from other countries. Including that very odd and yes, very funny show that Tony enjoys. Still Game is a riot. Haven't seen too many episodes as ... well ... the wife hates that show LOL, but I have been loving it. Very juvenile, which is great when I am in that mood. Loved the entire \"Jack moving into a new place\" ... arc(?) And I'm not taking a P*sh. LOL",

The Dynamo will also be without star midfielder Hector Herrera (undisclosed surgical procedure).\n\nForward Corey Baird departed as a free agent after last season while defender Griffin Dorsey opted to stick with the Dynamo.\n\nHouston recently re-signed midfielder Adalberto \"Coco\" Carrasquilla through the 2025 season with the club also holding two option seasons.\n\nCarrasquilla, 25, had three goals and eight assists last season. He's counting on the Dynamo equaling last season's success.\n\n\"Last year, our team proved that the Houston Dynamo can once again be true contenders in MLS,\" Carrasquilla said. \"... We have been working hard all preseason and hope to build a strong campaign for the upcoming year.\"\n\nThat Sporting Kansas City (12-14-8, 44 points) was in the Western Conference semifinals was quite the accomplishment as the club went 0-7-3 through its first 10 matches.\n\nSporting KC won six of their final nine regular-season matches to crash the field.\n\nMLS Comeback Player of the Year Alan Pulido (14 goals) will again pace the attack. The forward missed the entire 2022 season due to a knee injury.\n\nSporting KC added midfielder Memo Rodriguez while the departures included two long-time stalwart midfielders in Graham Zusi (15 seasons with SKC) and midfielder Roger Espinoza (14 seasons).\n\nVeteran forward Johnny Russell and goalkeeper Tim Melia are still around as part of the club's old guard.\n\nThe club has two designated player openings and SKC coach Peter Vermes said the search is ongoing.\n\n\"We're still looking and trying to make sure it's the right fit,\" Vermes said.",

Knapp also posted a 64, Wallace a 65 and Valimaki a 67 in the second round. They were one shot ahead of first-round leader Erik van Rooyen of South Africa (69 Friday).\n\nOrtiz, 28, won the Mexico Open in 2021, the final year before the PGA Tour put the tournament on its schedule. He sits at No. 669 in the Official World Golf Ranking but picked up a pair of victories on Mexico's professional golf tour last year.\n\nHe began his Friday round on the back nine and birdied Nos. 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18. The highlight came at the par-5 sixth hole, when his downhill, right-to-left eagle putt dropped from 30 feet away. Ortiz drove all 13 fairways in regulation.\n\nLike Ortiz, Knapp stayed bogey-free with his round and sank seven birdies. He tied for third at the Farmers Insurance Open last month.\n\nDefending champion Tony Finau shot a 67 on Friday to join a massive group in ninth at 6 under. The tie included 19 golfers as the last groups of golfers were finishing their rounds.\n\nThe projected cut line was at 2 under. Charley Hoffman (even par), South Koreans K.H. Lee and S.H. Kim (1 over) and Italy's Francesco Molinari (2 over) were among those expected to miss the cut.",

The Rams announced the deal, but terms were not disclosed.\n\nRobinson, 29, played for the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens before signing a veteran-minimum contract with the Rams last season. He emerged as a contributor at midseason and became a valuable starter down the stretch for a team that finished 10-7 and advanced to the playoffs.\n\nRobinson, an eight-year veteran, caught 26 passes for 371 yards and had a touchdown in four consecutive games during December.\n\nThe signing keeps the Rams' receiver corps intact. Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua are the other starters, while Tutu Atwell is entering the final year of his contract.",

        "title": "Eagles' A.J. Brown says 'I want to be here' and has no issues with Jalen Hurts",
        "body": "By EJ Smith, The Philadelphia Inquirer The Tribune Content Agency\n\nPHILADELPHIA - A.J. Brown wanted to set the record straight.\n\nThe Eagles star wide receiver called into 94.1 WIP Friday afternoon to address discussions surrounding him on the station and elsewhere earlier in the week. In a 15-minute interview live on air, Brown refuted the notion that he's unhappy on the Eagles or that he and quarterback Jalen Hurts have a tenuous relationship following the team's collapse last season.\n\n\"I think that's sort of B.S. I'm not going to get into me and his relationship on the air, but it's total B.S.,\" Brown said. \"It wasn't a problem when I was on my six-game streak. They weren't talking about that then, but they're talking about it when we're losing.\"\n\nBrown said the team's 1-6 finish to last season, a stretch that led to significant overhaul to the coaching staff, came down to players not executing. He rebutted the suggestion from one host that the Eagles were playing \"like the best team in the league\" while winning 10 of their first 11 games, pointing to the team \"scratching it out\" against lesser opponents during that stretch.\n\nWhen asked about Hurts' personality and reporting in The Philadelphia Inquirer about members in the Eagles organization wanting Hurts to open up more and be more available to his teammates during difficult times, Brown said he didn't want the quarterback to change.\n\n\"Jalen is himself,\" Brown said. \"I don't agree or disagree, he's going to be himself, and I'm not the person to try and paint him to be something that he's not or whatever the case may be. But when things were going good, you didn't hear those reports. The season pulled everybody every which way. There were ups and downs and more downs than ups. But when we were winning, you saw the same reaction from him on the sideline.\n\n\"But when we were losing, you still saw the same reaction, so how can you get upset at the same person for doing the same thing? A couple months ago, he was the greatest leader for this organization. So I don't agree or disagree. He's going to be himself and I want him to be nobody but himself.\"\n\nSimilar to the way he broke his media silence during the season, Brown foreshadowed his call to the radio station with a post to X, formerly known as Twitter, the day before. Brown said his account was hijacked during the Super Bowl and the impersonator sent several posts, but that he regained control of it before addressing the station's social media account late Thursday night.\n\nBrown said he called in to \"stand up to the bully\" and said he feels misunderstood by some fans and media members, claiming he is unfairly compared to Hall of Fame receiver Terrell Owens' dramatic tenure with the Eagles.\n\n\"The stigma between what T.O. did here, they always want to pinpoint that,\" he said. \"They just put me in this bubble with him and whatever he did in the past. And I know him, he's a great person, I don't want to speak badly, but I'm my own person. I don't move like that. I don't do any of that stuff with any of my teammates. That's the reason I'm on this show today. I'm the person who stands up to the bully.\"\n\nBrown also disputed claims that he wants to be traded from the Eagles when asked about his feelings being on the team. The station discussed whether he should be traded earlier this year.\n\n\"Why would someone think I wasn't even happy?\" Brown said. \"I want to be here. It's as simple as that. I love where I'm at, it's simple as that, next question.\"",

        "body": "NEW YORK -- The New York Civil Liberties Union is demanding Columbia University reinstate two pro-Palestinian student groups suspended last semester over protests against Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza.\n\nColumbia, which has been roiled by campus unrest following the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks on Israel, has until the end of next week before the NYCLU moves ahead with legal action, according to a letter made public Friday.\n\n\"If the university is unwilling to reverse its suspension decision and reinstate the groups, the NYCLU is prepared to file a lawsuit to vindicate their rights,\" the memo read.\n\nDonna Lieberman, executive director of the NYCLU, said the groups, Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, were \"peacefully\" speaking out on current events, when Columbia broke with its longstanding policies to quash the organizations.\n\nThe university has a board tasked with holding \"formal proceedings\" if a student group is accused of violating university policies, according to the letter. But the NYCLU said Columbia \"bypassed these governing procedures\" and \"unilaterally suspended\" the organizations on Nov. 10.\n\nThe former process would have afforded the groups several protections, the NYCLU said, whereas the administration's decision denied students the opportunity to appeal.\n\n\"That's retaliatory, it's targeted, and it flies in the face of the free speech principles that institutes of higher learning should be defending,\" Lieberman said in a statement.\n\nThe letter goes on to say that the two groups were not alone in organizing the Nov. 9 protest that most closely prompted the suspension, after what Columbia said then were repeated violations of university policies by the groups.\n\nAt the time, administrators also said the demonstration \"included threatening rhetoric and intimidation.\"\n\nNYCLU countered Friday the accusation had \"no basis in fact.\"\n\nThe suspension, which means the two groups cannot hold campus events or receive university funding, was slated to last through the fall term. But reinstatement came with contingencies, including that the organizations commit to complying with university policies and meeting with administrators.\n\n\"The university's priorities are not with its student body,\" said Safiya O'Brien, a junior studying political science and human rights at Barnard and a member of Students for Justice in Palestine. \"Certainly not with its Palestinian students and the overwhelming number of those that advocate for them.\"\n\nSpokespeople for Columbia declined to comment, but directed the Daily News to the university's interim policy on campus demonstrations.\n\n\"We are committed to free and open debate, and the principle that the right to speak applies equally to everyone, regardless of their viewpoint,\" it reads. \"Just as every member of our community has this right, they also have a corresponding responsibility not to interfere with the rights of others to speak, study, teach, and learn.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Columbia was slapped with a lawsuit over alleged campus antisemitism and continues to face a House probe. The NYPD is also investigating pro-Palestinian students' reports that they were sprayed with a noxious chemical at an on-campus protest.",

        "body": "BENGALURU: Union Minister, Dr Jitendra Singh on Friday said that Artificial Intelligence is revolutionising clinical medicine at a very fast pace and there is an urgent need for optimum integration between the existing and the newer tools of patient care.\n\nAt the same time, he said, integration is also required at a different level between the public and private sector on the one hand and on the other hand among various systems of medical practice combining allopathy with AYUSH to achieve the envisaged health goals through a synergised approach.\n\nSpeaking, as chief guest in the inaugural session of 2-day \"International Patient Safety Conference 2024\",Dr Jitendra said, India's recent success stories which have been hailed worldwide including the vaccine story, have proved beyond evidence that working in silos or in isolation has its limitations and further growth from here on is possible only through an integration at multiple levels.\n\nDr Singh said, for the first time after Independence, the healthcare sector has received top priority under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. PM Modi spoke about Digital Health from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day, he recalled.\n\nA renowned diabetologist himself, Dr Jitendra said, called for strong Public Private extended integration for the optimum results. He gave the example of a recently introduced Ph.D course in Biosciences, which is multiple in nature and even B.Tech or M. Tech streams could join.\n\nElaborating further on integration of various streams of healthcare, Dr Jitendra pointed out that during the COVID even the West started looking up to India in search of immunity building techniques drawn from Ayurveda, Homoeopathy, Unani, Yoga, Naturopathy and other oriental alternatives. He said, however, even after the COVID phase passes out, an optimum integration and synergism of different streams of medical management are the key to successful management of various diseases and disorders which may not be otherwise completely amenable to treatment by any single stream of medicine or the treatment given in silos.\n\nSimilarly, Dr Jitendra Singh said that our Bio-economy witnessed double digit growth rate year-on-year in the last 9/10 years under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. \"In 2014, India's bioeconomy stood at just about $10 Billion. This fiscal we are likely to touch $150 billion and we look forward to having $300 Billion by 2030,\" he said.\n\nDr Singh said, India has made rapid strides in the last 8/9 years. \"We had just 55 (Biotech) Startups in 2014, now we have more than 6,000,\" he said. Today there are over 3,000 Agritech Startups and are very successful in areas like Aroma Mission and Purple Revolution.\n\nDr Jitendra Singh said, Apollo has also played a pioneering role fulfilling the vision of its founder Dr Pratap Reddy in addressing the societal needs during the tough times of COVID.",

        "body": "GULFPORT, Miss. (WLOX) - A Monroeville, Alabama man was sentenced to 397 months - more than 30 years- in federal prison for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine and fentanyl after selling the drugs in Moss Point.\n\nCurtis Navelle Harrison, 46, was sentenced on February 21 in U.S. District Court in Gulfport.\n\nAccording to court documents, law enforcement officers conducted a controlled purchase of meth from Louis Booker, Jr. at a residence in Moss Point as part of an investigation.\n\nThree days later, law enforcement officers executed a search warrant on the residence. During the execution of the search warrant, Booker, Harrison, another adult male and a minor child fled from the residence.\n\nWhen the individuals were apprehended, officers located a $10 bill from the prior buy on Harrison's person.\n\nApproximately 200 grams of meth, firearms and fentanyl were also recovered from the residence.\n\nSubsequent investigation resulted in the discovery of text messages and social media messages between Harrison and Booker, which demonstrated that they were involved in a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute meth and fentanyl.\n\nOn June 14, 2023, a jury in federal court found Harrison guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute meth and fentanyl.\n\nIn imposing sentence, the court noted Harrison's prior criminal history. Specifically, the Court pointed to the fact that at the time of his commission of this offense, Harrison was out on parole from a life sentence in Alabama.\n\nAccording to documents submitted to the court, Harrison was sentenced to life in Alabama based on his prior convictions for attempted murder and 1st degree armed robbery of an undercover police officer.\n\nU.S. Attorney Todd W. Gee and Special Agent in Charge Joshua Jackson of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives made the announcement. The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and South Mississippi Metro Enforcement Team investigated the case. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jonathan Buckner and Lauren Dick prosecuted the case with support from Assistant U.S. Attorney Gaines Cleveland.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, fentanyl is approximately 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin. The DEA reports that two milligrams of fentanyl can be lethal, and one kilogram of fentanyl has the potential to kill 500,000 people. More facts on fentanyl can be found at https://www.dea.gov/resources/facts-about-fentanyl and https://www.dea.gov/resources/facts-about-fentanyl.",

Just lazy.\"\n\nWhite said it was important for the eager Force to pick their moments in attack.\n\n\"We've got some danger out wide, that's how we want to play the game - high pace, high skill,\" he said.\n\n\"We've just got to be ready that teams are going to be hard to crack.\n\n\"We're going to have to hang a bit tougher, because it's not all pretty out there.\n\n\"There's some big boys out there and we have to roll up our sleeves at times.\n\n\"But when we get those opportunities, we look pretty good.\"\n\nWallabies lock Izack Rodda, who missed round one due to a quad injury, is no certainty to return against the Rebels.\n\nCaptain Jeremy Williams (concussion) and Pearce (suspected broken nose) are also in doubt.",

        "title": "Archbishop, Christian group slam Assam bill against 'magical healing'  --  'no such term'",
        "body": "There is no such term as \"magical healing\" in Christianity, said Archbishop of Guwahati Archdiocese, John Moolachira, who's also the President of the Assam Christian Forum.\n\n\"We only heard about this phrase (magical healing) for the first time in the Assam Assembly. We don't simply go around healing -- it is part of our prayer. We have healing prayers like every other religion -- when sick people come, we pray for them -- individually, or by making them stand together in a group. We don't do magic to heal people. Why is the government making it illegal and punishable is what we don't understand,\" the Archbishop told ThePrint Thursday.\n\n\"We don't approve at all of what the government is trying to do.\"\n\nThe bill was introduced in the state legislative assembly by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pijush Hazarika on behalf of Sarma, who had earlier said it was needed to \"ban magical healing practices with the explicit goal of curbing evangelism\".\n\n\"No person shall take any part in healing practices and magical healing propagation for treatment of any disease, any disorder, or any condition relating to the health of a person directly or indirectly giving a false impression of treatment,\" it reads.\n\nOn 10 February, the Assam Cabinet approved the introduction of the bill in the assembly, with Sarma alleging that purported magical healing practices were being conducted to carry out religious conversions among tribal people in the state.\n\nAssam Christian Forum spokesperson Allen Brooks told ThePrint that Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees the people of their right to practice religion and that such allegations against Christians undermine this constitutional protection.\n\nThough not decided yet, the forum is contemplating all options, including approaching court against the legislation, he said.\n\n\"You are casting apprehensions on a particular community. Irrespective of any faith we belong to, when somebody is sick or in pain, we always turn to God for healing. God intervenes for the humans, and if this intervention is termed magical, where will the poor go?\" Brooks contended.\n\nWhile Section 3 of the bill states that the government is empowered to ban evil or magical healing practices, Section 4 allows ban on misleading advertisements and false claims related to such healing.\n\nFurther, Section 5 empowers the government to punish any act or promotion of such practices, and Section 6 extends this to include imprisonment for a year, extendable up to three years, or a fine of Rs 50,000, or both.\n\nThe bill specifies \"evil practices\" as any act of magical healing by any person primarily to exploit common people.\n\nAlso Read: Assam govt tables Bill imposing Rs 10 lakh fine & jail if found cheating in public recruitment exams\n\nThe Assam Christian Forum questioned why \"fringe elements\" have not been arrested despite issuing threats to the Christian missionaries.\n\nEarlier in February, a little-known Hindu outfit, Kutumba Surakshya Parishad, threatened Christian schools to remove all Christian symbols, including photographs and idols of Jesus and Mary, from school premises within a fortnight. It issued an ultimatum asking priests and nuns to discard their religious habits or robes.\n\nSatya Ranjan Borah, the parishad president, told the media in Guwahati that their objective is to check on conversion activities in schools practiced by Christian missionaries.\n\nAsserting that the government has failed to provide a sense of security for the Christians against such acts, Brooks said that \"fringe elements\" were \"spewing venom in public\".\n\n\"... that Christian schools are forcing conversions, that nuns and priests must give up their holy robes, that statues of Christ be removed from Christian institutions. Who is he to issue such ultimatums? And he still remains scot free,\" he said, without naming anyone.\n\nThe Archbishop also reiterated that there was nothing sinister about the religious symbols in the schools.\n\n\"All Christian schools have a moral influence on the students... Because we uphold morality wherever we are, and we are strict about it. We may have a statue of Jesus and Mary in some schools, but nobody is telling any student to bow down before them. It is an identity signifying that it's a Christian institution,\" the Archbishop told ThePrint.",

        "body": "One reason for the decline in sales could be the natural progression of game consoles\n\nSony recently announced that its PlayStation 5, released in 2020, is now in the latter stage of its life cycle.\n\nThis means the console is nearing the end of its primary market phase. The company stated that sales of the PS5 have not met expectations, leading to a reduction in the sales forecast for the current fiscal year, CNET reports.\n\nThe PlayStation 5 saw high demand upon its release, causing shortages that lasted for three years. However, sales have since slowed down, with weaker-than-expected holiday sales contributing to the decline.\n\nSony now expects a gradual decrease in sales in the coming financial year, partly due to the absence of major franchise titles planned for release.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Naomi Matsuouka, a senior vice president at Sony, mentioned that the company will focus more on balancing profitability and sales as the PS5 enters the latter stage of its life cycle.\n\nWhile Sony did not provide details about what this entails, it suggests a shift in strategy towards maximising profits as the console's popularity wanes.\n\nOne reason for the decline in sales could be the natural progression of game consoles. Typically, consoles like the PlayStation have a lifespan of around seven years before they are replaced by newer models.\n\nWith the PS5 nearing the end of its cycle, consumers may hesitate to purchase it, anticipating the release of a successor in the near future.\n\nWith the PS5 nearing the end of its cycle, consumers may hesitate to purchase it, anticipating the release of a successor in the near future.\n\nDespite the slowdown in sales, Sony continues to support older consoles, with the PS5 offering backward compatibility with the majority of PlayStation 4 games. This ensures that current PS5 owners can still enjoy a wide range of titles even as the console's life cycle approaches its end.\n\nLooking ahead, rumours about potential new gaming products from competitors like Microsoft and Nintendo add to the anticipation surrounding the gaming console market. Sony may feel pressure to respond with new offerings to remain competitive in the industry.\n\nWhile Sony does not have any major new games from its internal development studios planned for this year, there are still notable releases scheduled, including Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and a remaster of The Last of Us Part II. These releases, along with continued support for older titles, aim to maintain interest in the PS5 despite its position in the later stages of its life cycle.",

        "title": "Underwater data centres might be the wave of the future",
        "body": "The ever-growing mountains of data we generate need homes. Traditional land-based data centres, with their sprawling footprints and insatiable energy demands, are feeling the heat.\n\nThis has sparked interest in an interesting possible solution: underwater data centres. With Microsoft's successful Project Natick showcasing its potential, will your next data centre be located underwater?\n\nData centres have been submerged underwater in both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean since 2015. Microsoft deployed its first underwater data centre into the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of California, as part of an experiment called Project Natick. Phase 1 involved a vessel carrying a single rack with 24 servers.\n\nAfter Microsoft's successful proof-of-concept tests, oceanic data centres have expanded in size. Phase 2 of Project Natick features a shipping container-sized data centre with 12 racks, housing a total of 864 servers.\n\nIn addition, prototypes and tests for underwater data centres have been conducted by Beijing Highlander Digital Technology, based in China, and Subsea Cloud, based in Los Angeles, California. There have been discussions about the possibility of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google, and Facebook (Meta Platforms) exploring underwater data centre research.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of underwater data centres is the improved cooling efficiency. Traditional data centres generate significant heat, requiring substantial energy for cooling systems.\n\nThe ocean acts as a giant, virtually limitless air conditioner, eliminating the need for energy-guzzling cooling systems. This translates to significantly reduced carbon footprint.\n\nUnderwater data centres do not require water for cooling or any other operational needs.\n\nTherefore, these facilities do not put pressure on freshwater resources, which are crucial for both humans and the environment. Water sustainability metrics show that underwater data centres achieve a remarkable water usage effectiveness (WUE) of zero. By contrast, land-based data centres consume up to 4.8 litres of water per kilowatt-hour (kWh).\n\nData centre cooling is a crucial element in ensuring smooth operations, and it can significantly impact the overall expenses of the facility. As a result, underwater data centres have a financial advantage over traditional, land-based data centres due to their ability to minimise cooling costs.\n\nFor example, Microsoft claims that its most recent underwater data centre, which was submerged 36 metres below sea level, had temperatures about 10 degrees Celsius lower than land-based data centres.\n\nAccording to energy efficiency metrics, Microsoft's underwater computing facility has a power usage effectiveness (PUE) of 1.07, while the company's newly constructed land-based data centres have a PUE of around 1.125.\n\nUnderwater data centres offer a solution for achieving low-latency connectivity, which effectively reduces the time it takes for data to travel between its source and destination. Oceanic data centres offer a crucial advantage by providing fast and reliable connectivity to people living near the coast. It's worth noting that over half of the global population resides within 200 kilometres of the coast.\n\nUnderserved communities can benefit from faster and more seamless internet browsing, video streaming, gaming, and cloud services by situating underwater data centres close to a significant portion of the global population.\n\nTypically, underwater data centres are constructed using pre-fabricated and standardised modules, allowing for fast construction and delivery. As an illustration, Microsoft's underwater computing initiative aims to complete the deployment process within a timeframe of \"less than 90 days from the factory to operation.\"\n\nUnderwater data centres provide a remarkable level of dependability and consistent performance. The reason for this is that these modules are pre-fabricated and built to precise specifications in a controlled factory environment. This allows the oceanic data centres to operate independently, without the need for on-site staff, and remain maintenance-free for a period of up to 5 years.\n\nThe underwater data centre project by Microsoft showcased a process where the data centre vessel is retrieved, loaded with new servers, and then redeployed after each 5-year deployment cycle. In total, this process can be repeated for a maximum of four deployments throughout a 20-year lifespan. Afterwards, the underwater facility will be decommissioned and recycled.\n\nDon't dive in headfirst!\n\nHowever, underwater data centres come with their own unique set of challenges. The most difficult aspect of operating underwater data centres is likely to be hardware maintenance. When a server or disc drive needs to be replaced, sending personnel underwater or transporting the data centre to the surface is far more difficult than with land-based data centres. Robotic automation could help mitigate this issue, but until that technology matures, most data centre maintenance will continue to be performed by humans.\n\nConnecting underwater data centres to network cables is the only feasible way to ensure high-performance networking. That is feasible but expensive, particularly for underwater data centres located far from the shore.\n\nIn some ways, underwater data centres are extremely secure against physical intruders because it would be extremely difficult for trespassers to enter them undetected. On the flip side they may be vulnerable to attacks by terrorists or nation-state actors, who are more likely to target a facility at sea than one on defensible dry land.\n\nWhile obtaining energy from renewable offshore sources is appealing, they are not always reliable. Offshore wind farms, for example, stop working on calm days, and ocean currents can shift, leaving generators idle. Engineers would need to develop backup power sources to ensure the reliability of underwater data centres. While Project Natick demonstrated feasibility, scaling it up to handle the massive data processing needs of global tech giants remains a significant challenge.\n\nThere are environmental concerns as well. Leaks and potential damage to marine life remain potential risks despite advancements in mitigation strategies. Careful environmental impact assessments and regulations are crucial.\n\nNavigate tricky waters\n\nThese challenges are likely the reason why underwater data centres are still a topic of much discussion but have seen limited implementation. Project Natick has garnered significant attention, yet it's been three years since Microsoft retrieved it from the ocean and there have been no subsequent advancements in the project thus far.\n\nExploring hybrid solutions that combine land-based and underwater facilities could offer a more practical approach. Imagine a data centre archipelago, with some facilities on land and others submerged, each playing a role in the digital ecosystem. Additionally, technological advancements in materials, robotics, and remote monitoring could address the maintenance and repair challenges, making underwater interventions less like deep-sea dives and more like routine checkups.\n\nUltimately, the future of underwater data centres hinges on overcoming the current (get it?) challenges and balancing the benefits with potential risks. While it might not be an immediate solution, the potential rewards in terms of sustainability and efficiency make it a technology worth keeping an eye on.\n\nSo, the next time you're scrolling through your social media feed, remember that the data powering your experience might one day be stored in a server nestled deep beneath the surface.",

It is the right step in the right direction. With this alone, jobs will be created, and knowledge can be passed on.\"\n\nIn his remarks, the Managing Director of Sacral Industries Limited, Mr Rajeev Girglani, expressed profound appreciation to the Japanese delegation on the visit, stressing that the company would continue to play its part in enhancing Nigeria's economic prosperity.",

        "body": "WINSTON-SALEM - You can have the best of both worlds to score runs, as evidenced by Wake Forest's fourth inning against Dayton.\n\nThe Deacons' seven-run inning was the flashpoint of a 14-2 win on Friday at David F. Couch Ballpark.\n\nThere's a fine line between acknowledging the start to the season hasn't been perfect and overreacting to four games -- about 7% -- of a 56-game regular season.\n\nEntering Friday, Wake's team average (.218) ranked 214th of 292 Division I teams. Slugging percentage (.403) was better, at 142nd -- but this team isn't supposed to be middle of the pack in much of anything.\n\nAfter making things work in an opening weekend sweep, the Deacons (4-1) lost at UNC Greensboro on Tuesday.\n\nThat's why there was a change in the batting practice approach over the last couple of days.\n\n\"We really took it personally,\" third baseman Adam Tellier said. \"We felt like we let our pitchers down, they threw a great game on Tuesday. Going to practice on Wednesday and Thursday, we knew we had to make some changes.\"\n\nThat meant a long team meeting on Wednesday about offensive approach, and more competitive rounds of batting practice, coach Tom Walter said.\n\n\"Feel-good batting practice is you know what pitch is coming, everybody's just kind of standing there and everybody's trying to homer,\" Walter said. \"We changed it up to where we mixed in breaking balls. We're having rounds where they only hit breaking balls, we're having two-strike rounds, and then rounds where they only hit fastballs.\n\nSo, about that fourth inning.\n\nTate Ballestero Jr. led off with a shot through the left side to beat a shift and legged it into a double. He tagged up to third on a fly out to center and scored on a grounder up the middle, flagged down by pitcher Anthony Hattrup. Later in the inning, Cameron Nelson went from first to third on a single.\n\nThere's still power in this lineup. After Nick Kurtz was intentionally walked to load the bases, Seaver King struck out.\n\nJake Reinisch launched the first pitch he saw over the wall in right-center field, breaking the game open at 9-2.\n\n\"With two outs, looking for something early in the count,\" Reinisch said. \"I knew he was throwing his fastball for strikes, that was what I was expecting. I missed under it a bit, elevated the ball and it was a great moment.\"\n\nMissed it?\n\nWell, in the sense that every home run is a mistake, sure.\n\n\"The goal is always to hit a line drive, so when you miss under it a bit, that's where you get the homers,\" Reinisch said with a smile.",

        "body": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Former talk show host Wendy Williams is thanking well-wishers for their response to the revelation she has been diagnosed with dementia and ahead of the airing of Lifetime documentary about her struggles.\n\n\"I want to say I have immense gratitude for the love and kind words I have received after sharing my diagnosis of Aphasia and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Let me say, wow! Your response has been overwhelming,\" Williams said in a statement released to The Associated Press through a representative for her care team. \"The messages shared with me have touched me, reminding me of the power of unity and the need for compassion.\"\n\nWilliams' statement came a day after her team revealed the 59-year-old has been diagnosed with with primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The order signed by an appellate judge, who was reviewing a petition to block the documentary's release, says such a ruling would be an \"impermissible prior restraint on speech that violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\"\n\nThe ruling clears Lifetime's two-night broadcast plan for \"Where is Wendy Williams?,\" which includes footage of the former talk show host and interviews.\n\nAn attorney for Williams' guardian did not immediately return an email seeking comment Friday.\n\n\"Lifetime appeared in court today, and the documentary 'Where is Wendy Williams?' will air this weekend as planned,\" the network said in a statement.\n\n\"I continue to need personal space and peace to thrive,\" Williams said in her statement Friday. \"Please just know that your positivity and encouragement are deeply appreciated.\"\n\nShe credited the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration for its support and efforts to educate the public about the disease, which is the same form of dementia Bruce Willis has, after her diagnosis was announced.\n\nFrontotemporal dementia is a rare disease that affects parts of the brain controlling behavior and language. These parts of the brain shrink as the disease gets worse. The disease often includes primary progressive aphasia, which means it's causing problems with language skills. A person with this type of FTD may have trouble finding words or understanding speech.\n\nWilliams' self-titled daytime talk show ended in 2022 because of her health issues. Sherri Shepherd, who filled in for Williams as a guest host, received her own show.\n\nWilliams said in 2018 that she had been diagnosed years before with Graves' disease, which leads to the overproduction of thyroid hormones and can cause wide-ranging symptoms that can affect overall health. Thursday's statement from Williams' care team said Williams' dementia diagnosis happened in 2023.\n\nPeople magazine reported in a cover story on Williams this week that some family members say they don't know where she is and cannot call her themselves, but that she can call them.\n\nThe article said the Lifetime documentary crew, which set out in 2022 to chronicle Williams' comeback, stopped filming in April 2023 when, her manager \"and jeweler\" Will Selby says in footage for the film, she entered a facility to treat \"cognitive issues.\" Her son says in the documentary that doctors had connected her cognitive issues to alcohol use, People reported.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "title": "OU Baseball: Oklahoma Opens Home Season by Crushing Wright State",
        "body": "By John E. Hoover Sports Illustrated Oklahoma Sooners News, Analysis and More\n\n]Oklahoma's bats exploded, and the Sooners got a dominant start on the mound.\n\nThat was the right combination for an OU rout on Friday at L. Dale Mitchell Park as Oklahoma opened its home schedule by pounding Wright State 20-0 in Norman.\n\nThe Sooners improved to 3-2 on the season, while Wright State fell to 1-3.\n\nLeft-hander Braden Davis pitched six shutout innings and allowed only three hits and a walk while striking out eight of the 23 batters he faced. He threw 92 pitches, including 55 strikes, and lowered his season ERA to 0.82.\n\nDavis had plenty of support at the plate as the Sooners racked up a season-high 21 hits.\n\nSnyder's sacrifice fly to right center brought home Spikerman for a 7-0 lead in the fourth, but the Sooners were only getting started.\n\nSix runs came across in the fifth, starting with Spikerman's two-run single to right that scored Mudler and Pettis for a 9-0 lead. Easton Carmichael's double to left allowed Spikerman to score for a 10-0 lead, and Snyder's double to right moved Carmichael to third and scored Madron to put the Sooners up 11-0. Nicklaus' double to left sent Carmichael home for a 12-0 lead, and Mackenzie made it 13-0 with an RBI groundout that scored Snyder.\n\nOU added four in the seventh when Dasan Harris bounced a two-out grounder on the infield -- his first collegiate hit -- and drove home Carter Frederick to make it 14-0. Mudler then ran it up with a three-run home run to right field for a 17-0 lead.\n\nAfter Wright State left hander Joey Valentine walked the bases loaded in the eighth, Isaiah Lane delivered his first collegiate hit with a three-run triple off the right field wall for a 20-0 lead. It was OU's first 20-spot since 2022.\n\nSpikerman went 3-for-3 with two RBIs and three runs scored, while Mudler was 3-for-5 with three RBIs and three runs and Madron was 2-for-4 with three RBIs and three runs. Snyder was 3-for-4 with three RBIs and a run scored, and Nicklaus had two hits and two RBIs. Pettis had two hits and two runs, Lane had three RBIs and Mackenzie had two RBIs. Only one OU starter didn't record a hit.\n\nJett Lodes relieved Davis and recorded four strikeouts in a scoreless seventh and eighth.\n\nMyles Meyer pitched the ninth and added a strikeout, giving the Sooners at least 13 strikeouts in each of their first five games, but Meyer also gave up a double and two walks to load the bases before Brad Pruett closed things out with another pair of strikeouts, their 15th.\n\nFriday's blowout was the first of a four-game series. The team meet again on Saturday with a 1 p.m. doubleheader, then finish the series at 2 p.m. Sunday. All games can be seen on ESPN+.",

        "title": "Expect the unexpected: Coach hints at surprise Matildas line-up",
        "body": "Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson has hinted that there could be some unexpected names in the starting line up for the first leg against Uzbekistan in a bid to manage player fatigue.\n\nGustavsson dubbed the first leg of the final Olympic qualifiers as \"extremely important\" but said so was managing player welfare.\n\nThe 23 women in the camp have all come from a range of domestic competitions - some midway through season, some in their off-season and others in pre-season.\n\nAdding to the juggle is players like Alanna Kennedy who have only recently returned from injury or Arsenal midfielder Kyra Cooney-Cross who has had limited minutes in the top flight English league.\n\nCaitlin Foord has played more than 1000 minutes of football for Arsenal this season, while Mary Fowler has played just a touch over 500 minutes.\n\nWorld Cup defensive star Clare Hunt could be one of the overloaded players - spending 1200 minutes on the field for PSG across their domestic competition and the Champions League. While fellow defender Clare Polkinghorne hasn't played since the Swedish league wrapped up in November.\n\nIn his pre-match press conference Gustavsson, who didn't want to reveal his starting 11, hinted that some of the decisions were out of his hands and based on recommendations from the medical staff.\n\n\"We came in with a lot of challenges this camp, some players were coming in with a lot of game time with fatigue and niggles, some players coming in with very little game time and underloaded,\" he said.\n\n\"So it was important for us to find the right sweet spot in terms of training load and make sure the ones that came in with some fatigue and niggles are fresh on Saturday.\n\n\"Without revealing the line-ups there are a couple of players that came in with overload and niggles and we need to be mindful how we use them now in this first game if we do, how many minutes and how that can influence the availability in the second game and so forth.\n\n\"So we look at form and physical readiness for the game as well.\n\n\"We are going to go all in and maximise the performance in game one.\"\n\nGustavsson dropped another hint that the line up could feature a few surprises in order to have the experienced stars on the bench as \"game changers\".\n\n\"When you're planning you are planning for a strong starting line up but maybe even a stronger finishing line-up because game changers are key in games like this,\" he said.\n\nTHE MATCH\n\nDespite Uzbekistan being the clear underdogs Gustavsson wasn't willing to count them out of the contest.\n\nThe 47th ranked team in the world has never qualified for an Olympics before, or played at a FIFA Women's World Cup.\n\nBut Gustavsson was quick to point out that any team playing at home can be tough to handle.\n\n\"You can play an opposition doing a certain thing, you look at what they have done in the past, but this is an Olympic qualifier against us, on home soil,\" he said.\n\nGustavsson said Uzbekistan could bring a completely different approach to the match, play one way for part of the game and then switch it up.\n\n\"They have shown they are really well organised and have a clear game plan. They've been in a very long pre-camp going into this game as well.\n\n\"We know we are going to be playing a team that is very well prepared. We need to understand that and also be prepared for different types of challenges.\"\n\nOne of those challenges the players will have little control over or time to adapt to is the weather.\n\nIt is forecast to reach a high of just two degrees in Tashkent on Saturday.\n\nWhile the players based in Europe and England will be more accustomed to the brisk weather it will be a shock to the system for the A-Leagues players.\n\n\"The sports science team does a tremendous job in terms of acclimatisation - whether it is nutrition, whether it is recovery or training load or preparing for weather as well. I'm sure we are going to be well prepared,\" Gustavsson said.\n\n\"It doesn't matter the circumstances around them when they step on the field they always give it 100 per cent, no matter the pitch, the wind, the rain, the weather.\n\n\"This is a game when we have a game plan that we want to try to execute but we also need to be able to adapt to what's thrown at us whether it's tactics or weather or the pitch circumstances.\"\n\nBALANCE IS KEY\n\nWhile Gustavsson kept the game plan under lock and key he did reveal the intention is still play the attacking, high-pressing style of football the Matildas became known for during the recent World Cup.\n\n\"No matter who steps on there we're going to be true to who we are,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not talking formation when I talk about who we are, I'm talking about the principle of how we play. We're always going to be a pressing team.\n\n\"We're going to be a high octane energy team that likes to attack with numbers. We looked at different ways of how we can create those chances when the space is less which we think it is going to be in this game.\"\n\nDefender Alanna Kennedy, who is fit after a recent calf injury in the WSL, said she was feeling good and the team was \"looking sharp\".\n\n\"To have made it this far Uzbekistan is obviously a team of good quality and I think for us it will be about being patient,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\"I'm sure we will find them in a bit of a block at different points in the game and just being patient with our game plan and clinical in the moments that we do get up top, so it's definitely a challenge ahead but we are well prepared for it.\"\n\nTIGHT TURN AROUND\n\nWhile the focus is on the first leg of the two-game series Gustavsson said medical staff had also had to form a plan to optimise recovery ahead of the second game in Melbourne on Wednesday.\n\nPlayers will have to endure a 20 hour flight from Tashkent to Melbourne, arriving on Monday - just two days before their second clash.\n\nKennedy said it was far from ideal but something the players, especially being from Australia, had to come to accept as part of being a professional footballer.\n\n\"I think if anyone is well prepared for it, it will be us,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\"Of course there is the extra one percenters that you have to be more careful with, looking after your body recovery, what you eat and obviously what we prioritise during those few days, like just getting the legs going after the long flight.\n\n\"As a player I think it is more about mindset and what we can do mentally to be prepared but as well as physically for the short turnaround.\"\n\nGustavsson said lots of strategies would be used to maximise recovery time.\n\n\"We need to be world class when we travel,\" he said.\n\n\"Whether it is compression pants or getting used to jet lag, or sleeping routines or nutrition or recovery strategies - the players are all phenomenal when it comes to that and it comes down to mindset as well.\n\n\"I know once we step off that plane and come to Australia the players will be prepared as they can.\n\n\"I also know they are going to be refuelled and energised by the fans and coming back to play on home soil. That is going to compensate for a lot of lack of energy from travel.\"",

        "title": "The idol who inspired Crichton's captaincy",
        "body": "Stephen Crichton says former Panthers teammate Nathan Cleary has been his \"idol\" and someone he'll base his leadership off as he faces the biggest challenge of his career as Canterbury's new captain.\n\nThe three-time premiership winner was handed the reins earlier in the week and admitted on Friday night that the 12-6 pre-season challenge loss to the Sharks was the first time he'd ever skippered a team.\n\nHe lost his first coin toss and then the game as both teams dropped the ball non-stop in greasy conditions, but he showed signs of promise as a rookie leader with a couple of big shots in defence to inspire his comrades.\n\nIt was a big call by coach Cameron Ciraldo to install the new recruit as skipper just one year after Matt Burton and Reed Mahoney were announced as co-captains, but it's a move that has the backing of the squad and could take Crichton's game to another level.\n\n\"I think coming here with the experience I've had for the past few years at a successful club, it was the way I communicated with the team and what's best for the team,\" the strike centre said.\n\n\"The way that I lead at training (has been important). A lot of the younger boys, I'm teaching them lessons that I've learnt as well throughout my time. It's all fallen into place after that.\n\n\"I'm pretty grateful for the opportunity to lead this great club.\n\n\"With the team that we have, it's basically a fresh roster so I wanted to step up in the leadership role and talk about what I see and feel what's best for the side.\"\n\nCrichton didn't have to say much when he was at Penrith given Nathan Cleary and Isaah Yeo were there to lead the side, but he studied his former halfback and hopes that helps him on and off the field this season.\n\n\"Going into Origin, Teddy is obviously a big one. But other than him, it's always been 'Clez' who's been a massive idol for me to learn off on and off the field,\" he said, conceding he'll have to watch a replay of the World Club Challenge because he'll be at church.\n\n\"I haven't really spoken to anyone (about it). They're probably off getting ready for a game. I'm trying to learn it myself with my own mentality.\n\n\"If I can learn how to lead myself first then I can lead the team as well. Nothing really changes with the way I play.\"\n\nCrichton played 20 minutes at left centre on Friday night with Blake Taaffe at fullback, but the former Souths utility didn't have a great game with a couple of uncharacteristic drops under the high ball.\n\nIt will undoubtedly lead to speculation that Crichton could be moved to fullback, and the man himself says that's still on the cards.\n\n\"I've been training basically everywhere, wherever Ciro wants,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm trying to do reps at fullback, wing, centre to give myself an opportunity. If I do get switched around then I know what my job is and I can nail it for the team.\n\n\"I think everything is pretty much a chance for me. For me, it's team first. Whatever Ciro wants for the team to make our team stronger (is what I'll do).\"\n\nWhile his stint was brief, Bulldogs fans should be excited about the left edge of Matt Burton, Viliame Kikau, Crichton and Josh Addo-Carr.\n\nScoring points has been an issue for the blue and whites, but this is an edge brimming with speed and size, with the Penrith connection set to bring out the best in Burton.\n\n\"The main reason for me playing tonight was to get that combination right, and see how we're going,\" Crichton said.\n\n\"Burto running the ball is a massive factor. He's been a bit quiet the past few seasons, and I'm trying to unleash him, to [help him] play what he sees and play happily - any NRL player plays at their best when they're happy on and off the field.\n\n\"On the field, off the field, [it's important] we're always on the same page. Even if there are errors, it's about connecting with him quickly.\n\n\"He's leading our left edge as well. He's been really good.\"",

        "title": "NRA loses landmark trial over millions in wasted donor funds",
        "body": "By Ethan M Steinberg, Bloomberg News The Tribune Content Agency\n\nThe National Rifle Association and its longtime leader Wayne LaPierre were found liable for violating New York law with lavish spending of donor funds, denting the gun rights group's invincible aura after a six-week trial and years of embarrassing revelations in court.\n\nA jury in lower Manhattan concluded on Friday, its fifth day of deliberations, that the NRA misused its charitable assets under state law governing nonprofit organizations and that LaPierre breached his duty to the group by enriching himself in the process, including with flights to the Bahamas.\n\nThe verdict, capping a civil lawsuit that New York Attorney General Letitia James filed in 2020, is perhaps the biggest legal setback for the NRA since it was founded in 1871. It is especially resonant in an election year on a polarized American political landscape in which gun rights, crime and mass shootings are particularly heated. And it comes on the heels of a big win James scored last week against Donald Trump in her civil fraud case.\n\nBut the NRA case was most notable for showing the self-dealing and turmoil at the top of the once high-flying nonprofit. It played out after years in which the NRA saw a sharp decrease in its funds and membership and drew to a close as LaPierre retired at 74, citing health problems, following three decades as the face of the gun lobby.\n\n\"One of its biggest assets has been the perception of its strength,\" Ohio State University accounting professor Brian Mittendorf said of the group before the verdict. The allegations of corruption on display in open court for weeks on end could shake that perception, said Mittendorf, who has studied the organization's finances.\n\nFrom 2016, when the NRA helped elect Trump president, through 2022, its revenues fell more than 40% and member dues by half, according to court documents and filings with the Internal Revenue Service. At the same time, its legal fees multiplied by six, surpassing $40 million, and it has reduced spending on programs for its members.\n\nThe organization said it remains vital.\n\n\"The NRA has more than 4 million members and represents millions of other law-abiding gun owners,\" a spokesman said in a statement before the verdict. \"Our adversaries continue to predict the 'demise' of the NRA - in the face of landmark legal victories, legislative wins at every level, and a wave of grassroots support.\"\n\nThe extravagant spending was on display throughout the trial. It included $600,000 in private flights to the Bahamas alone, for LaPierre and his family, one adding up to $37,000. Testifying on and off for three days, he told the jury that his friend and NRA vendor David McKenzie paid for yacht outings. LaPierre splurged on $274,000 in boutique suits, all on an NRA vendor's dime.\n\nOne high point of the trial was the testimony of Oliver North, the conservative stalwart and former NRA president who says he was forced out after raising concerns about the spending. North testified that in 2019 he pushed for an outside audit of the NRA's finances but that LaPierre refused.\n\n\"I was absolutely stunned,\" North testified about the spending allegations. \"It's called corruption.\"\n\nDuring its deliberations the six-member jury requested 4,000 pages of documents. The jurors filed into the courtroom periodically to hear answers to questions they had sent to New York State Supreme Court Justice Joel Cohen as they waded through a long and detailed verdict sheet.\n\nLaPierre was a formidable power broker. In 2016 the NRA spent more on Trump than it had on any other candidate. Trump, the Republican front-runner in this year's presidential election, has leveraged gun rights as a potent campaign issue and often spoken at the NRA's annual convention. He promised an NRA crowd this month that \"no one will lay a finger on your firearms\" if he is elected.\n\nThe NRA forged \"a political identity around guns, where guns weren't seen as tools for recreation and defense, but instead as sort of symbols of their values and political beliefs,\" said Matthew Lacombe, a political science professor at Case Western Reserve University who researches the group.\n\nLaPierre's face was so valuable to the organization that it signed an agreement with him to continue using his name, signature and image after his retirement - at an annual cost of $500,000 to the group, court filings show. That agreement has since been stricken.\n\nDespite the verdict, the NRA will continue to wield considerable influence, said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies gun policy. It has proved adept at mobilizing voters and cemented its influence by lobbying for judges, from state courts to the Supreme Court, who support its cause. The decline in its fortunes \"comes at a time when gun rights are particularly strong,\" Winkler said.\n\nMichael Bloomberg, founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, helped found and currently supports Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates safety measures.\n\nLawyers for the defendants argued that the attorney general, a Democrat, had sued their clients to fulfill a promise she made on the campaign trail, where she characterized the NRA as \"an organ of deadly propaganda.\"\n\nBut James has broad powers to investigate nonprofit groups registered in New York, where the AG's office has been more vigilant than many in holding nonprofits to account, said Linda Sugin, a Fordham University law professor who studies charities. Sugin said James's case centered on the proposition that NRA executives breached their fiduciary duties in a way that defied the group's very mission.\n\n(Beth Wang contributed to this report.)",

        "title": "California federal court next for FBI informant re-arrested in Las Vegas",
        "body": "By Katelyn Newberg, Las Vegas Review-Journal The Tribune Content Agency\n\nLAS VEGAS - A California federal judge will determine if former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov will be released from custody following his second arrest in Las Vegas on Thursday.\n\nAlexander Smirnov, 43, is facing charges of lying to officials about an alleged multimillion-dollar bribery scheme involving President Joe Biden, his son Hunter and a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nAccording to court filings, Smirnov is scheduled to appear in a Los Angeles federal court on Monday morning for a detention hearing. U.S. District Judge Otis Wright II, who will oversee Monday's hearing, wrote in an order on Friday that defense attorneys sought an emergency hearing in Nevada to secure Smirnov's release, \"likely to facilitate his absconding from the United States.\"\n\nDefense attorneys have also filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, typically used to appeal a judge's decision, in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The document was filed under seal as of Friday afternoon.\n\n\"We are advocating for Mr. Smirnov's release in both the federal district court and in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,\" Smirnov's Las Vegas defense attorneys, David Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld, said in a statement. \"We will have no comment on the case and look forward to appearing in the appropriate federal court.\"\n\nSmirnov's attorneys filed an emergency motion on Thursday in an attempt to prevent federal authorities from transporting Smirnov to California.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Daniel Albregts denied the motion in a minute order on Friday, indicating the Nevada federal court no longer has jurisdiction over the case.\n\nAlbregts had ordered Smirnov's release from custody on Tuesday, after finding that prosecutors did not prove it was necessary to hold Smirnov in custody to ensure he would appear in court.\n\nHe was arrested again on a warrant out of California while at his attorneys' office on Thursday morning, according to court documents.\n\nChesnoff and Schonfeld alleged that re-arresting Smirnov, who has lived in Las Vegas for two years, was an \"interference with his cherished Sixth Amendment rights,\" according to a motion filed Thursday for Smirnov's release from custody.\n\nSmirnov is accused of falsely reporting to his FBI handler that executives from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma paid President Joe Biden and Hunter Biden $5 million each around 2015, a claim that has become central to the Republican impeachment inquiry in Congress.\n\nAn indictment returned on Feb. 14 charged Smirnov with making a false statement to federal agents and creating a false and fictitious record.\n\nProsecutors have said that Smirnov worked as an FBI informant for at least 10 years, and that he has ties to multiple foreign intelligence agencies, including Russia.\n\nSmirnov has lived in Las Vegas for two years, and spent 16 years before that living in California, defense attorney's have written in court documents. He has lived in Las Vegas with his significant other, Diana Lavrenyuk, in a home that she owns, Chesnoff and Schonfeld wrote.\n\nProperty records show that in February 2022, a Diana Lavrenyuk purchased a $980,000 unit in the One Turnberry Place luxury condominium complex overlooking the Strip near Paradise Road and Elvis Presley Boulevard.\n\nLittle else is known about Smirnov. When he was released from custody on Tuesday, he exited the federal courthouse in downtown Las Vegas arm-in-arm with a man and a woman wearing face masks. Smirnov covered his face with a hat, hooded jacket and sunglasses, and refused to speak with reporters.\n\nProsecutors have written in court documents that Smirnov had plans to leave the U.S. on a \"months-long, multi-country foreign trip\" scheduled for two days after he was initially arrested, during which Smirnov claimed to have plans to meet with foreign intelligence contacts.\n\nSmirnov has access to more than $6 million between him and Lavrenyuk, prosecutors claim, which he did not disclose to authorities. Defense attorneys have argued that Smirnov disclosed his personal assets to authorities and was not asked to disclose \"the business account.\"\n\nHe has both a U.S. and Israeli passport, which Smirnov was made to turn over to authorities when he was released from custody on Tuesday. Prosecutors have painted him as a flight risk who may flee the U.S.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Smirnov told the FBI the false allegations about the bribery scheme in 2020, after expressing bias against Joe Biden to his FBI handler when Biden was the presume Democrat presidential candidate.\n\n\"And the false information he provided was not trivial,\" prosecutors wrote in their appeal of Smirnov's detention status. \"It targeted the presumptive nominee of one of the two major political parties in the United States. The effects of Smirnov's false statements and fabricated information continue to be felt to this day.\"\n\n_____",

        "body": "WASHINGTON - Democrats were outraged in 2020 when Republicans pushed through a replacement for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg shortly before the presidential election, calling it one of the darkest days in the Senate's history.\n\nBut the first justice to call Amy Coney Barrett to congratulate her on the Senate's confirmation vote was one of her new liberal colleagues, Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nBarrett, the third nominee chosen by President Donald Trump, was at the White House when Sotomayor called her cell phone to welcome her to the \"family.\"\n\nAnd when Barrett arrived at the court a few weeks later, not knowing how she would be received, Sotomayor appeared at her office laden with Halloween candy for Barrett's children.\n\nIt's such small gestures of kindness and concern, Barrett said Friday, that make the court a more collegial place than a polarized public may think.\n\n\"There are so many, many things that you can do to bring the temperature down,\" Sotomayor said as part of a discussion the pair had at the National Governors Association winter meeting on respectfully navigating disagreements. \"When we disagree, our pens are sharp. But on a personal level, we never translate that into our relationships with one another.\"\n\nTheir discussion Friday was part of a yearlong initiative by the National Governors Association to help both voters and elected officials learn the skills of \"healthy conflict.\"\n\n\"There's an exhausted majority of Americans who are fed up with divisive rhetoric and feel their voices are drowned out by louder extremes,\" said Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, this year's chair of the association.\n\nThe justices may need lots of candy, movie nights, and lunches together to get through the next few months when they will be deciding multiple politically charged cases.\n\nThey are weighing whether Trump can be tried on charges that he tried to steal the 2020 election and whether he can be kicked off the ballot for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nTwo years after overturning the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to an abortion, the justices are considering whether to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone and if hospitals can provide emergency abortions in states with strict abortion bans.\n\nThe court will also decide the fate of two gun-control rules and whether to uphold laws from Texas and Florida that Republicans in those states say are needed to stop the \"censorship\" of conservative voices on social media.\n\nAnd they're being asked to weigh in on the hot-button issue of state bans of gender-affirming care for transgender minors.\n\nAt the panel discussion, Barrett and Sotomayor were asked about none of those cases.\n\nNor were they asked about the ethics controversies that have rocked the court and contributed to its low public approval ratings.\n\nInstead, they talked about their regular lunches together, the occasional movie nights and how they all - as Barrett put it - \"wear the same color black robe.\"\n\n\"You hear so much about our deeply divided court, or the 6-3 court,\" she said. \"But when you looked at the docket for last year, I think that might have been true in five cases or so. The vast number of cases were unanimous or almost unanimous.\"\n\nBoth Barrett and Sotomayor said their lifetime appointments insulate them from being tied too closely to a president or a party.\n\n\"Thankfully for us, presidents don't last that long, right? There's eight years. So for us to be beholden to one of them is a little crazy,\" Sotomayor said to laughter from governors. \"No, seriously, there is built into the system a protection, which is lifetime appointment, that should give us the freedom to grow as we grow in the job as well.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Same black robe: Sotomayor and Barrett on why SCOTUS isn't as polarized as you may think",

        "body": "Supreme Court to hear arguments on online content moderation\n\nWASHINGTON - As Congress has largely stayed at a standstill over internet policy, the Supreme Court will hear arguments Monday in cases that could shake up a broad swath of the online landscape and define how lawmakers could regulate social media companies.\n\nThe two cases stem from challenges to laws in Texas and Florida that would restrict how the largest social media sites and other online platforms moderate their content and require them to explain to an account holder whenever they do remove or alter a post.\n\nThe states have argued the laws would prevent online platforms from discriminating against anyone online based on their viewpoints and ensure transparency in the content moderation process for social media platforms that carry much of public discourse nationwide.\n\nTexas and Florida enacted the laws as part of conservative backlash to perceived \"censorship\" of conservative views by major social media platforms, and they included requirements that those sites have detailed explanation and appeals process when people are blocked.\n\n-CQ-Roll Call\n\nDefense says cellphone data raise questions about start of Willis-Wade relationship\n\nATLANTA - Nathan Wade appeared to make at least 35 visits to the Hapeville neighborhood where Fani Willis was living before the district attorney hired him to lead Fulton County's election interference prosecution, according to cellphone data included in a court submission filed Friday.\n\nThe filing, by attorneys for Donald Trump, raises fresh questions about the relationship between the two prosecutors, which the former president and other defendants argue has tainted the case against them and should result in Willis and her office being disqualified.\n\nTrump's lawyers relied on data collected from Wade's cellphone and cellphone tower transmissions that they said tracked his movements. However, at least one expert interviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution questioned the accuracy of the cellphone data findings.\n\nIf they are correct, they could contradict Wade's testimony last week in which he said he had visited Willis at her condo in Hapeville no more than 10 times before he was hired in November 2021. It also indicates Wade twice arrived in the area late at night and left early the next morning in the months before Willis and Wade said their relationship became romantic early in 2022.\n\n-The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\nThe Atlantic is record-warm right now. What does that mean for hurricane season?\n\nTAMPA, Fla. - Hurricane season is still months away, but warm winter waters in the Atlantic Ocean are already concerning some forecasters.\n\nWater temperatures in the north Atlantic Ocean currently rival those normally seen during the summer months. By some estimates, this type of heat would only be seen once every 142,000 years.\n\nResearchers say we are reaching the Atlantic Ocean's winter peak - the first week of March typically marks the coldest water temperatures of the year and experts say the unseasonably warm waters will only get hotter after that.\n\nOn Florida's west coast, the Gulf of Mexico has cooled off after a blistering summer that recorded hot tub-like temperatures. While a strong El Ni\u00f1o was responsible for warming Gulf waters just a few months ago, it has also boosted winter storms, whipping up winds and lowering surface temperatures. But experts expect that as the summer approaches and El Ni\u00f1o wanes, Gulf waters will warm up again.\n\n-Tampa Bay Times\n\nRussian defector's murder in resort catches Spain off guard\n\nSpain expressed concern over the killing of a Russian military deserter in a popular tourist resort, though stopped short of pointing the finger at the Kremlin's security services as the government awaits the forensic report.\n\nMaxim Kuzminov, a former Russian air-force captain who defected to Ukraine last year, was shot dead earlier this month in Alicante, southeast Spain. A Ukrainian military intelligence spokesman confirmed his killing, without giving further details. A top Russian intelligence official referred to Kuzminov as a \"moral corpse\" because of his actions.\n\nEl Pais, Spain's largest newspaper, reported on Thursday that local intelligence services are linking the murder to the Russian government and suspect the killers came from outside the country.\n\nSpanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said in an interview late yesterday that the matter \"needs to be treated with a lot of care,\" adding that the government is in contact with the Russian ambassador in Madrid. \"Of course the possibility that a person could be murdered on Spanish soil in this context is something we take very seriously,\" he told Bloomberg in New York.\n\n-Bloomberg News",

        "body": "February's full moon, known as the snow moon, is set to peak on Saturday, shining bright around the world in the night sky.Related video above: Full moons: When are they and what are their names?The moon will be at its most full at 7:30 a.m. ET Saturday, according to EarthSky, but to the human eye, the moon will appear full for a couple of days, so the best time to view it will be the nights before and after its peak.While called the snow moon, the golden orb will look almost like any ordinary full moon. But this moon will be a micromoon, meaning it might look slightly smaller than usual.\"It's just a little bit farther away from Earth than (the moon) typically is,\" said Rachel Klima, a planetary geologist and lunar expert with Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.\"It's about 10% smaller. So it may look a little bit smaller. But a lot of the time, when people see a really huge moon, it's usually because it's low on the horizon, rather than because of the actual distance of it,\" Klima said. \"(The micromoon) won't be super, super tiny. It'll just be a little bit smaller than your average full moon that you look up at.\"The full moon phase occurs when the moon, Earth and the sun are in alignment, in that order. February's full moon will occur when the moon is at its farthest point from Earth in its elliptical orbit, known as the apogee, Klima said. The micromoon will also be dimmer than the moon typically looks by about 30%, according to EarthSky, allowing for slightly better visibility of nearby celestial objects, without the average luminous interference.This year, the snow moon will shine next to the constellation Leo's brightest star, Regulus. Near the moon's peak, on the night of Feb. 23, the star will be seen just below the orb, according to EarthSky.You obviously don't need any special equipment to enjoy moon-gazing, but binoculars can be a good tool for those looking to see its features and craters clearly, Klima said. While full moons are best observed in clear skies, even in slightly cloudy weather the moon will occasionally peek through the clouds, she added.Lunar explorationOn Thursday, the Odysseus lunar lander successfully soft-landed near the moon's south pole, accomplishing a feat that had not been attempted by any vehicle launched from the United States since the Apollo program ended more than five decades ago. Intuitive Machines' IM-1 mission also marked the first commercial spacecraft to soft-land on the moon amid a renewed international dash for the lunar surface.\"The nice thing to kind of dream about when you look up at the moon right now is how much renewed activity there is internationally,\" Klima said. \"We're basically opening up a new era of lunar exploration. ... As these different companies start to land on the moon, we're going to be able to learn much, much more and really have this whole new world -- economic world and scientific world -- opened up to us.\"More full moons this yearOf the 12 full moons in 2024, February's full moon is the only micromoon of the year, while the September and October lunar events will be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky.Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger and brighter in the night sky. Some astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee -- its closest approach to Earth in orbit.Here are the remaining full moons of 2024:March 25: Worm moon April 23: Pink moon May 23: Flower moon June 21: Strawberry moon July 21: Buck moon Aug. 19: Sturgeon moon Sept. 17: Harvest moon Oct. 17: Hunter's moon Nov. 15: Beaver moon Dec. 15: Cold moon Solar and lunar eclipsesMultiple eclipses will occur in 2024.The most highly anticipated of these events is the total solar eclipse on April 8, which will be visible in parts of Mexico, the United States and Canada. A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, completely blocking the sun's face.Those within the path of totality, or locations where the moon's shadow will completely cover the sun, will see a total solar eclipse. People outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse in which the moon only obscures part of the sun's face.A total solar eclipse won't be visible across the contiguous United States again until August 2044.An annular solar eclipse will occur on Oct. 2 over parts of South America. This type of eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, except the moon is at the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, so it can't completely block the sun. Instead, annular solar eclipses create a \"ring of fire\" in the sky as the sun's fiery light surrounds the moon's shadow.Meanwhile, a penumbral lunar eclipse will be visible to many across Europe, North and East Asia, Australia, Africa, North America and South America between March 24 and 25.A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when the sun, Earth and moon align so that the moon passes into Earth's shadow. A penumbral lunar eclipse is more subtle and happens when the moon moves through the outer shadow, or penumbra, of Earth.A partial lunar eclipse, in which Earth moves between the sun and the full moon without being perfectly aligned, will appear over Europe and much of Asia, Africa, North America and South America between Sept. 17 and 18.Check Time and Date's website to see when each of these eclipses will appear.Meteor showers of 2024Sky-gazers can look forward to a multitude of meteor showers this year, according to the American Meteor Society.

        "body": "A jury in New York found former NRA gun lobby chief Wayne LaPierre liable Friday for corruptly mismanaging the organization.\n\nLapierre and a senior executive of the National Rifle Association must pay a penalty of $6.35 million \"for years of corruption and greed,\" said state attorney general Letitia James.\n\nLaPierre, facing a civil trial where he was accused of using the National Rifle Association as a personal piggy bank, was found by the jury to have cost the organization $5.4 million because of his misconduct -- although he has since repaid $1 million of that.\n\nLaPierre said in January he would step down as president of the NRA, citing unspecified health reasons.\n\nJames brought a lawsuit against LaPierre and top NRA leaders in August 2020, leading to Friday's verdict.\n\n\"In New York, you cannot get away with corruption and greed, no matter how powerful or influential you think you may be,\" James said after the verdict was announced, in a post on X, the former Twitter.\n\n\"Everyone, even the NRA and Wayne LaPierre, must play by the same rules,\" James added.\n\nShe called this \"a major victory,\" which comes on top of a judge's recent order against former president Donald Trump to pay at least $355 million in penalties for business fraud -- another case brought by James.\n\nLaPierre and NRA senior management misappropriated millions of dollars in NRA funds to pay for a lavish lifestyle that included private jets, expensive meals, and family trips to the Bahamas, James said before the trial started.\n\n\"The NRA, as a New York-registered not-for-profit, charitable corporation, has legal obligations to use its funds for charitable purposes, not to support the lavish lifestyles of senior management and organization insiders,\" she said.\n\nMore from this section The Time Bomb in Empty Office Buildings Newly renovated PATH station opens today in Harrison Children treated to free ice skating fun at Abe Stark rink in Brooklyn\n\n\"(The) investigation found that instead of serving NRA members, senior management blatantly disregarded New York state and federal laws, and even internal NRA policies.\"\n\nIn January, James' office announced that Joshua Powell, the NRA's former executive director of operations and chief of staff to LaPierre, had reached a $100,000 agreement with her office. Powell was one of five defendants in the lawsuit.\n\n- Failed gun law reform -\n\nThe 150-year-old NRA is the leading promoter of gun rights in the United States and has focused its efforts since the 1970s on battling gun restrictions.\n\nPolls have showed time and again that the majority of Americans want greater gun control, in a country where mass shootings occur regularly, schoolchildren are subjected to routine shooter drills, and there are more guns than people.\n\nBut politicians have repeatedly failed to reform gun laws.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2012, the NRA and its allies in the firearms industry combined to pour $80 million into US congressional and presidential races, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential election, the NRA spent about $20 million for ads attacking Democrat Hillary Clinton and another $10 million for ads supporting Republican Donald Trump.\n\nnr-gw/dw/acb",

        "body": "Local favorite Alvaro Ortiz has his sights set on a second Mexico Open title as he heads into the weekend with a share of the lead at the PGA Tour event at Puerto Vallarta.\n\nOrtiz delighted the home crowd with a seven-under par round of 64 and sits atop the leaderboard along with England's Matt Wallace, Finland's Sami Valimaki and American Jake Knapp, all on 11-under.\n\nOrtiz teed off on 10 and made five birdies on his first nine holes then added an eagle on the par-5 sixth hole.\n\n\"It was pretty solid. From tee to green it was as good as it could be. I hit the ball very well and just felt very comfortable out there,\" said the 28-year-old.\n\n\"It was very clean, very stress free and I was glad to be able to make that eagle on six. I feel like I was losing a little bit of momentum leaving a couple putts go, but it was good to get that one back. Happy to be in the position I'm in,\" he added.\n\nOrtiz won the event in 2021 when it was part of the PGA Tour Latinoamerica and having played college golf at the University of Arkansas and clinching the 2019 Latin American Amateur Championship he now plays on the second tier Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nThe Guadalajara native said he is enjoying the backing of the Mexican crowd at Vidanta Vallarta.\n\n\"It's awesome, it's awesome to have my family, to have my friends, to have my people. We don't get to play much in Mexico, so it's pretty cool to be out here, to be playing well and feel the support from them,\" he said.\n\n- Ball-striker's course -\n\nWallace also made eagle on the sixth during a blistering five-under on his final nine holes as he made up for two bogeys on the 10th, his first hole, and the 15th.\n\nMore from this section The Time Bomb in Empty Office Buildings Newly renovated PATH station opens today in Harrison Children treated to free ice skating fun at Abe Stark rink in Brooklyn\n\n\"I think it's just a ball-striker's golf course. You obviously need to putt well every single week, but it is a ball-striker's golf course where if you're hitting fairways and greens, you've not going to be giving shots away and you can make a bunch of birdies,\" he said.\n\nValimaki has won twice on the DP World Tour and put himself in contention despite bogeys on the second, 13th and 14th.\n\nThe 25-year-old from Nokia finished strongly with birdies on the par-3 17th and par-5 18th.\n\nKnapp had a chance to grab the solo lead as the light faded but saw his seven foot birdie putt on the 18th lip out.\n\nThe American rookie however was happy to have carded a bogey-free 64 with the highlight a 27-foot birdie putt on the par-3 11th.\n\n\"I drove it really well again and then struck the ball really, really well. Didn't have my best day on the greens, but struck the ball really well, gave myself a ton of chances. Was pretty stress free for the most part,\" he said.\n\nSouth Africa's Erik van Rooyen was a shot behind the leading quartet after following up his opening round 63 with a solid 69.\n\nAmericans Andrew Novak and Mark Hubbard were both two shots further back on 134.\n\nsev/bb",

        "body": "Some Haitians sleep in makeshift camps in the streets of Mexico City with other migrants\n\nIt wasn't his first choice, but Mexico is now home for Evens Luxama -- along with thousands of other Haitians forced to put their hopes of migrating to the United States on hold.\n\nThe 34-year-old is one of a growing number of people from the crisis-torn Caribbean nation pursuing what activists have described as the \"Mexican dream,\" building a life in a land that migrants traditionally hurried through.\n\n\"I wanted to go to the United States, but I don't think there's another country that offers the opportunity that Mexico does right now,\" said Luxama, who hopes his partner and young daughter will join him in the Mexican capital soon.\n\n\"In Mexico, they accept you, not only Haitians, but all foreigners,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"They do everything to get you regularized, so that you have your papers, and with your papers, you can bring your family to live with you,\" he said.\n\nHaiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, has seen years of worsening security due to raging gang violence, with its political, economic and public health systems also in tatters.\n\nLuxama fled overseas last year after a gang kidnapped a cousin and the sister of his girlfriend, who were released after paying a ransom.\n\nAt the time, the Mexican embassy was the only one open in Port-au-Prince to process his visa request.\n\nLuxama now works in Mexico City as an editor at a video production company -- one of an unprecedented 141,000 people who sought refuge in the Latin American nation in 2023, mostly from Haiti, Honduras and Cuba.\n\nIn a recent video call to his parents in Haiti, he asked about the situation back home.\n\n\"You already know, son -- a lot of problems,\" his father replied.\n\nHaiti has spiraled deeper into chaos since president Jovenel Moise was assassinated in 2021.\n\nGangs run rampant in large swaths of the country, and homicides in Haiti more than doubled last year to nearly 4,800, according to a UN report released last month.\n\nIn October, the United Nations Security Council authorized the deployment of a multinational force to help restore order.\n\n\"It's almost impossible to live in Haiti,\" said Luxama, who fears that he will be powerless to help his family when danger comes.\n\n- 'Mexican dream exists' - More from this section The Time Bomb in Empty Office Buildings Newly renovated PATH station opens today in Harrison Children treated to free ice skating fun at Abe Stark rink in Brooklyn\n\nMigration from Haiti is not a new phenomenon for Mexico.\n\nIn September 2021, after a deadly earthquake in their country, thousands of Haitian migrants crowded into the Mexican border city of Ciudad Acuna hoping to cross over to the United States.\n\nThere were already Haitian communities in Tijuana on the Mexican-US border and the southern city of Tapachula, where thousands gathered seeking permits to travel through Mexico to the United States.\n\nThese days, Haitians are also a growing presence in Mexico City, many of them working in low-paid, informal jobs.\n\nSome sleep on the streets in makeshift camps.\n\nRule changes and the \"militarization\" of the southern US border are among the reasons prompting migrants to stay in Mexico, said Rafael Velasquez, country director at the humanitarian group International Rescue Committee.\n\n\"Many people arrive and when they see that there is an opportunity (in Mexico), that the Mexican dream exists, they decide to give it a try,\" he said.\n\nAlthough the United States is allowing thousands of Haitians with expired travel documents to stay on, it only applies to those who arrived before November 6, 2022.\n\nOn a street in the Mexican capital, five Haitians drilled the pavement to install pipes near an abandoned cinema.\n\nOne of them, who gave his name as Jony and speaks Spanish, acts as an interpreter between the bosses and the rest of the workers, who speak Haitian Creole.\n\nHe was part of a wave of Haitians who arrived in Brazil after a devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010 that left more than 300,000 people dead.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, many of them headed north from Brazil as well as Chile, citing discrimination and difficulty obtaining legal status, according to New York-based Human Rights Watch.\n\nEvery day, Jony travels several hours by subway to and from his workplace, and sometimes spends days waiting to be paid his salary.\n\nAlthough he originally wanted to go to the United States, he said he stayed in Mexico because \"it's easier to return to Haiti one day.\"\n\nyug/axm/dr/acb",

        "title": "OU Baseball: Oklahoma Opens Home Season by Crushing Wright State",
        "body": "By John E. Hoover Sports Illustrated Oklahoma Sooners News, Analysis and More\n\n]Oklahoma's bats exploded, and the Sooners got a dominant start on the mound.\n\nThat was the right combination for an OU rout on Friday at L. Dale Mitchell Park as Oklahoma opened its home schedule by pounding Wright State 20-0 in Norman.\n\nThe Sooners improved to 3-2 on the season, while Wright State fell to 1-3.\n\nLeft-hander Braden Davis pitched six shutout innings and allowed only three hits and a walk while striking out eight of the 23 batters he faced. He threw 92 pitches, including 55 strikes, and lowered his season ERA to 0.82.\n\nDavis had plenty of support at the plate as the Sooners racked up a season-high 21 hits.\n\nSnyder's sacrifice fly to right center brought home Spikerman for a 7-0 lead in the fourth, but the Sooners were only getting started.\n\nSix runs came across in the fifth, starting with Spikerman's two-run single to right that scored Mudler and Pettis for a 9-0 lead. Easton Carmichael's double to left allowed Spikerman to score for a 10-0 lead, and Snyder's double to right moved Carmichael to third and scored Madron to put the Sooners up 11-0. Nicklaus' double to left sent Carmichael home for a 12-0 lead, and Mackenzie made it 13-0 with an RBI groundout that scored Snyder.\n\nOU added four in the seventh when Dasan Harris bounced a two-out grounder on the infield -- his first collegiate hit -- and drove home Carter Frederick to make it 14-0. Mudler then ran it up with a three-run home run to right field for a 17-0 lead.\n\nAfter Wright State left hander Joey Valentine walked the bases loaded in the eighth, Isaiah Lane delivered his first collegiate hit with a three-run triple off the right field wall for a 20-0 lead. It was OU's first 20-spot since 2022.\n\nSpikerman went 3-for-3 with two RBIs and three runs scored, while Mudler was 3-for-5 with three RBIs and three runs and Madron was 2-for-4 with three RBIs and three runs. Snyder was 3-for-4 with three RBIs and a run scored, and Nicklaus had two hits and two RBIs. Pettis had two hits and two runs, Lane had three RBIs and Mackenzie had two RBIs. Only one OU starter didn't record a hit.\n\nJett Lodes relieved Davis and recorded four strikeouts in a scoreless seventh and eighth.\n\nMyles Meyer pitched the ninth and added a strikeout, giving the Sooners at least 13 strikeouts in each of their first five games, but Meyer also gave up a double and two walks to load the bases before Brad Pruett closed things out with another pair of strikeouts, their 15th.\n\nFriday's blowout was the first of a four-game series. The team meet again on Saturday with a 1 p.m. doubleheader, then finish the series at 2 p.m. Sunday. All games can be seen on ESPN+.",

        "title": "Vancouver's 2026 FIFA World Cup Fan Festival could be held at the PNE | Offside",
        "body": "Artistic renderings of the new PNE Amphitheatre at Hastings Park in Vancouver (Revery Architecture/City of Vancouver) and the 2022 FIFA World Cup Fan Festival in Doha, Qatar (FIFA).\n\nA massive world-class festival will coincide with Vancouver's co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup in Summer 2026.\n\nAs per FIFA World Cup tradition, following FIFA's requirements, each host city for the tournament is required to stage a FIFA Fan Festival throughout the duration of the tournament.\n\nThis is a free large-scale elaborate festival, providing an added experience for the general public to take in the tournament -- especially if they are unable to land on any match tickets -- and effectively enhance a host city's experience. Its programming includes not only live screenings of the matches, but also other activations such as live music, arts, culture, and hospitality hosting.\n\nThe 2026 FIFA World Cup will be no exception, with all 16 host cities in Canada, the United States, and Mexico required to put on their own FIFA Fan Festival throughout the tournament, which will last 39 days this year -- about a week longer than previous tournaments, due to the expanded format.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nAs announced earlier this month, BC Place Stadium in downtown Vancouver will host a total of seven matches across seven dates spanning from June 13 to July 7, with the last Vancouver match being a coveted knockout Round of 16 match. The tournament will open in Mexico City on June 11 and climax in New Jersey/New York on July 19.\n\nEach FIFA Fan Festival is designed to accommodate thousands of people at any given time.\n\nTo fulfill its requirements, the City of Vancouver confirmed to Daily Hive Offside that it is currently recommending to FIFA that the PNE fairgrounds in Hastings Park in East Vancouver be used for the five-week-long Vancouver festival. However, the City says a final decision has yet to be announced by their delivery partners and FIFA.\n\nThe City adds that the final details on their FIFA Fan Festival will not be available until FIFA has completed their process for announcing sites in all host cities, which the City expects to be made before this summer.\n\nThe municipal government did not provide their rationale for recommending the PNE, but the use of the fairgrounds coincides with the completion of a major new entertainment venue at the location -- the $104 million new PNE Amphitheatre, which will be a fully-covered outdoor venue under a landmark mass-timber roof with a capacity for up to 10,000 people. On a clear day, it will also be backdropped by the North Shore Mountains.\n\nConstruction on the footprint of the existing dilapidated amphitheatre begins early this year for a targeted completion by early 2026.\n\nFor past tournaments, FIFA generally had a preference for festival sites within close proximity to the stadium venues, given the critical mass synergies for fan atmosphere, and at iconic, central, and accessible locations.\n\nFor example, Cape Town held their 2010 festival at the Grand Parade, and Rio de Janeiro staged their 2014 festival at Copacabana Beach.\n\nSeattle has already indicated it is proposing to host its 2026 festival at its new Waterfront Park -- a newly revamped major public space on the downtown Seattle waterfront, as part of its public realm project following the demolition of the Alaskan Way Viaduct. It is expected to reach completion in 2025.\n\n\"On the edge of the Salish Sea, Seattle's Fan Fest will take place on the new Waterfront Park, a convening point from time immemorial. This location is within walking or biking distance from Seattle Stadium, and puts fans from all over the world in the heart of the city, with easy access to ground-floor small businesses and historic neighbourhoods that make Seattle unique,\" reads the description by Seattle's FIFA World Cup organizers.\n\nToronto's 2026 festival site could potentially be located at Exhibition Place on the fairgrounds of the CNE, taking advantage of the event-friendly space and the ability to co-locate it with their stadium venue of BMO Field, or at Nathan Philip Square at Toronto City Hall in downtown Toronto. Both sites were also used for major fan festivals during the 2015 Pan American Games.\n\nDuring the 2010 Winter Olympics, the City of Vancouver established two major fan festival sites in downtown Vancouver -- Live City Yaletown at David Lam Park, and Live City Downtown at Larwill Park parking lot, which is set to become a construction site over the coming years for the new home of the Vancouver Art Gallery.\n\nThe cost of staging both Live City festival locations, which featured high-quality programming and activations, including nightly fireworks, was about $18 million.\n\nFor the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, a comparatively small-scale fan festival was held at the Larwill Park parking lot. The entire cost of staging this festival was about $1.2 million.\n\nIn 2017/2018, during the bidding phase, the City of Vancouver estimated the 2026 FIFA Fan Festival would carry a cost of between $10 million and $20 million to stage.\n\nIn 2022, the provincial government indicated the planning, staging, and hosting of the 2026 FIFA World Cup in Vancouver will carry a total cost between $240 million and $260 million. This includes any potential contributions from the federal government and the City of Vancouver, stadium and training site rentals and other sources, the FIFA Fan Festival, and potential marketing opportunities that are expected to generate revenue.\n\nWith the announcement of the match allocations earlier this month, some decisions are also expected to be made on the official practice venues for the competing visiting national teams later this year.",

Knapp also posted a 64, Wallace a 65 and Valimaki a 67 in the second round. They were one shot ahead of first-round leader Erik van Rooyen of South Africa (69 Friday).\n\nOrtiz, 28, won the Mexico Open in 2021, the final year before the PGA Tour put the tournament on its schedule. He sits at No. 669 in the Official World Golf Ranking but picked up a pair of victories on Mexico's professional golf tour last year.\n\nHe began his Friday round on the back nine and birdied Nos. 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18. The highlight came at the par-5 sixth hole, when his downhill, right-to-left eagle putt dropped from 30 feet away. Ortiz drove all 13 fairways in regulation.\n\nLike Ortiz, Knapp stayed bogey-free with his round and sank seven birdies. He tied for third at the Farmers Insurance Open last month.\n\nDefending champion Tony Finau shot a 67 on Friday to join a massive group in ninth at 6 under. The tie included 19 golfers as the last groups of golfers were finishing their rounds.\n\nThe projected cut line was at 2 under. Charley Hoffman (even par), South Koreans K.H. Lee and S.H.

        "body": "A Southern California socialite was found guilty Friday of murder and other charges in the hit-and-run deaths of two young brothers in a crosswalk more than three years ago.Authorities alleged that Rebecca Grossman, wife of a prominent Los Angeles burn doctor, fatally struck Mark Iskander, 11, and brother Jacob, 8, while speeding behind a car driven by then-lover Scott Erickson, a former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher.Prosecutors charged Grossman with two felony counts each of murder and vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence and one felony count of hit-and-run driving resulting in death.The deadly crash occurred on the evening of Sept. 29, 2020, in Westlake Village, a city on the western edge of Los Angeles County.Grossman was not charged with being under the influence, but former baseball player Royce Clayton testified he had joined her and Erickson at a nearby restaurant where Erickson had two margaritas and Grossman had one, the Los Angeles Times reported.Prosecutors presented evidence that the data recorder in Grossman's white Mercedes showed she was speeding at up to 81 mph and tapped her brakes, slowing her to 73 mph, less than two seconds before a collision that set off her airbags.Grossman's lead defense attorney, Tony Buzbee, repeatedly blamed Erickson for the deaths, suggesting the retired baseball player's car hit Jacob, hurling him to a curb, and then hit Mark, throwing him into the path of Grossman's Mercedes, the Times reported.Buzbee did not immediately return a request for comment after the verdict was read.An attorney for Erickson has said the former ballplayer denies contributing in any way to the tragedy. Erickson was initially charged with a misdemeanor count of reckless driving but it was dismissed after he made a public service announcement, the Times said.The victims' mother, Nancy Iskander, testified that the black SUV did not hit her sons but could have hit her and her 5-year-old son, Zachary. She said she dove out of the way and pulled Zachary to safety.The mother said she did not see Mark and Jacob being struck but three eyewitnesses testified they saw a white or light-colored vehicle hit the boys.Grossman's husband, Dr. Peter Grossman, medical director of the Grossman Burn Centers, was called to testify by his wife's defense. The Grossmans are founders of the Grossman Burn Foundation, which promotes care and support of burn survivors.Peter Grossman said he and his wife were separated at the time, living separate lives under the same roof while dating other people. His wife was involved with Erickson in 2020, he testified.Under prosecution questioning, Peter Grossman said that out of the hundreds of times he rode with Rebecca Grossman he had no recollection of her ever speeding.\n\nA Southern California socialite was found guilty Friday of murder and other charges in the hit-and-run deaths of two young brothers in a crosswalk more than three years ago.\n\nAuthorities alleged that Rebecca Grossman, wife of a prominent Los Angeles burn doctor, fatally struck Mark Iskander, 11, and brother Jacob, 8, while speeding behind a car driven by then-lover Scott Erickson, a former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher.\n\nProsecutors charged Grossman with two felony counts each of murder and vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence and one felony count of hit-and-run driving resulting in death.\n\nThe deadly crash occurred on the evening of Sept. 29, 2020, in Westlake Village, a city on the western edge of Los Angeles County.\n\nGrossman was not charged with being under the influence, but former baseball player Royce Clayton testified he had joined her and Erickson at a nearby restaurant where Erickson had two margaritas and Grossman had one, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nProsecutors presented evidence that the data recorder in Grossman's white Mercedes showed she was speeding at up to 81 mph and tapped her brakes, slowing her to 73 mph, less than two seconds before a collision that set off her airbags.\n\nGrossman's lead defense attorney, Tony Buzbee, repeatedly blamed Erickson for the deaths, suggesting the retired baseball player's car hit Jacob, hurling him to a curb, and then hit Mark, throwing him into the path of Grossman's Mercedes, the Times reported.\n\nBuzbee did not immediately return a request for comment after the verdict was read.\n\nAn attorney for Erickson has said the former ballplayer denies contributing in any way to the tragedy.

        "body": "Lara Trump said Republican voters want the RNC to pay Donald Trump's mounting legal bills from his various criminal and civil cases. She acknowledged the RNC rules may not allow this but said voters see the cases as political persecution against Trump and the country. Lara Trump spoke at Tru...\n\nWATERFORD TOWNSHIP, Mich. -- The Michigan Republican Party was deep in debt when a longtime party donor who had given more than $1 million over the past decade asked for a meeting with its chairwoman.\n\nKristina Karamo turned down the donor. Her reasoning, according to two people familiar with the matter, was that he was a \"Republican in Name Only,\" or a \"RINO,\" an insult long used to denigrate members of the party seen as not conservative enough.\n\nToday, the party's finances are so dire that Karamo has sued former party leaders so she can get permission to sell the organization's headquarters. And she's refusing to leave her post even as former President Donald Trump and national Republicans have installed a new ally in her place.\n\nThe cash crunch and power struggle within the Michigan GOP, long a bastion of traditional conservatism, is a case study in the party's new phase nationally in the era of Trump, where no longer are the competing elements simply for or against him. Instead, pro-Trump factions in Michigan and elsewhere are fighting over how best to represent his \"Make America Great Again\" movement, with some openly alienating lifetime Republicans and undermining the party's work in key swing states.\n\nWhile Trump is widely expected to win Tuesday's Michigan primary, his campaign is trying to improve Republican standing in a state that could decide a potential Trump rematch in November with Democratic President Joe Biden. But some of Trump's most ardent supporters aren't going along with his efforts to replace Karamo and they openly question his judgment.\n\n\"I don't think he should be involved in state politics to begin with,\" said Steve Willis, chair of the Clinton County GOP, in south central Michigan near Lansing. \"He's just listening to people that have his ear and he makes a decision.\"\n\nTrump's allies have moved to replace Karamo with Pete Hoekstra, a former nine-term congressman who was Trump's ambassador to the Netherlands. Hoekstra is now responsible for assembling a functioning network of activists, donors and political staff while acknowledging, as he said in an interview, that he \"can't build a whole political party in eight months.\"\n\n\"We need to build the brand back, with our grassroots and our donor class,\" Hoekstra said. \"My intention is to rebuild those relationships.\"\n\nKaramo, who did not respond to several text messages and phone calls seeking comment, retains control of the party's bank accounts, social media and email. A lawsuit seeking to force her to relinquish power is being heard by a Michigan judge.\n\nElected party chairwoman last year, Karamo is an ardent Trump supporter who rose to prominence by repeating false claims about voter fraud in Detroit and denying that Trump lost the 2020 election.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nShe inherited a state party torn by infighting and facing millions in debt. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a rising Democratic Party star, had easily won reelection and Democrats clinched control of the Legislature.\n\nBut many donors and longtime activists say Karamo refused to work with them. In turn, many of them stopped giving, cutting off resources to a party that had been accustomed to raising at least $20 million -- and at times more than $30 million -- to help candidates statewide.\n\nJohn Kennedy, the longtime CEO of a medical implant manufacturer and part of a core of Michigan's most loyal donors, was told that Karamo would not meet with \"RINOs,\" according to two people familiar with his story who weren't authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nKennedy declined to comment in response to an email inquiry.\n\nA lawyer for the National Republican Congressional Committee, which oversees U.S. House races nationwide, sent the state party a letter questioning whether Karamo and her staff were spending money intended for campaigns on day-to-day expenses instead.\n\n\"I will not deny that we are growing increasingly alarmed by reports that the MIGOP is in dire financial straits and grossly mismanaging their limited funds,\" NRCC general counsel Erin Clark wrote. \"These do not seem to be the actions of a state party that adheres to conservative principles; or frankly, one that has the desire or ability to elect Republicans to office.\"\n\nKaramo's opponents started trying to push her out last fall. She was ousted in a January vote. The Republican National Committee this month sided with Hoekstra and recognized him as the rightful state party chair.\n\n\"He brings credibility and acceptability with donors -- to major donors -- that's for sure,\" said former Michigan GOP Chairman Ron Weiser, who has contributed millions to the party over decades. \"People know him and he's from west Michigan, which is where you have your largest percentage of major donors on the Republican side.\"\n\nHoekstra is trying to stitch together a patchwork of helpful GOP county chairs, such as in populous Oakland County northwest of Detroit, and outside political groups working on Michigan campaigns, all while inviting donors back who had left the party.\n\n\"It's not nearly where we need to be. The nice thing is you call these people and ask for help and they they've been ignored for a year, and they feel, hallelujah, someone's asking them to do something,\" he said.\n\nBut Karamo isn't going quietly and neither are her supporters.\n\nA significant number of local GOP activists remain loyal to Karamo and echo her stated beliefs that Trump not only won Michigan, but was cheated out of a second term overall. Among the federal and state reviews proving that belief false is a GOP-led state Senate investigation in 2021 that confirmed Biden beat Trump by 3 percentage points in Michigan.\n\nIosco County GOP Chair David Chandler deflected criticism about Karamo, saying \"fundraising isn't really a requirement.\" He said efforts to remove her were \"a coup by the big establishment Republicans to try to seize what they couldn't get in a decent, honest election.\"\n\nMichigan to automatically register people to vote when exiting prison\n\nMichigan to automatically register people to vote when exiting prison",

But this moon will be a micromoon, meaning it might look slightly smaller than usual.\"It's just a little bit farther away from Earth than (the moon) typically is,\" said Rachel Klima, a planetary geologist and lunar expert with Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.\"It's about 10% smaller. So it may look a little bit smaller. But a lot of the time, when people see a really huge moon, it's usually because it's low on the horizon, rather than because of the actual distance of it,\" Klima said. \"(The micromoon) won't be super, super tiny. It'll just be a little bit smaller than your average full moon that you look up at.\"The full moon phase occurs when the moon, Earth and the sun are in alignment, in that order. February's full moon will occur when the moon is at its farthest point from Earth in its elliptical orbit, known as the apogee, Klima said. The micromoon will also be dimmer than the moon typically looks by about 30%, according to EarthSky, allowing for slightly better visibility of nearby celestial objects, without the average luminous interference.This year, the snow moon will shine next to the constellation Leo's brightest star, Regulus. Near the moon's peak, on the night of Feb. 23, the star will be seen just below the orb, according to EarthSky.You obviously don't need any special equipment to enjoy moon-gazing, but binoculars can be a good tool for those looking to see its features and craters clearly, Klima said. While full moons are best observed in clear skies, even in slightly cloudy weather the moon will occasionally peek through the clouds, she added.Lunar explorationOn Thursday, the Odysseus lunar lander successfully soft-landed near the moon's south pole, accomplishing a feat that had not been attempted by any vehicle launched from the United States since the Apollo program ended more than five decades ago.

As these different companies start to land on the moon, we're going to be able to learn much, much more and really have this whole new world -- economic world and scientific world -- opened up to us.\"More full moons this yearOf the 12 full moons in 2024, February's full moon is the only micromoon of the year, while the September and October lunar events will be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky.Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger and brighter in the night sky. Some astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee -- its closest approach to Earth in orbit.Here are the remaining full moons of 2024:March 25: Worm moon April 23: Pink moon May 23: Flower moon June 21: Strawberry moon July 21: Buck moon Aug. 19: Sturgeon moon Sept. 17: Harvest moon Oct. 17: Hunter's moon Nov. 15: Beaver moon Dec. 15: Cold moon Solar and lunar eclipsesMultiple eclipses will occur in 2024.The most highly anticipated of these events is the total solar eclipse on April 8, which will be visible in parts of Mexico, the United States and Canada. A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, completely blocking the sun's face.Those within the path of totality, or locations where the moon's shadow will completely cover the sun, will see a total solar eclipse. People outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse in which the moon only obscures part of the sun's face.A total solar eclipse won't be visible across the contiguous United States again until August 2044.An annular solar eclipse will occur on Oct. 2 over parts of South America. This type of eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, except the moon is at the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, so it can't completely block the sun. Instead, annular solar eclipses create a \"ring of fire\" in the sky as the sun's fiery light surrounds the moon's shadow.Meanwhile, a penumbral lunar eclipse will be visible to many across Europe, North and East Asia, Australia, Africa, North America and South America between March 24 and 25.A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when the sun, Earth and moon align so that the moon passes into Earth's shadow. A penumbral lunar eclipse is more subtle and happens when the moon moves through the outer shadow, or penumbra, of Earth.A partial lunar eclipse, in which Earth moves between the sun and the full moon without being perfectly aligned, will appear over Europe and much of Asia, Africa, North America and South America between Sept. 17 and 18.Check Time and Date's website to see when each of these eclipses will appear.Meteor showers of 2024Sky-gazers can look forward to a multitude of meteor showers this year, according to the American Meteor Society.

        "body": "Supreme Court to hear arguments on online content moderation\n\nWASHINGTON - As Congress has largely stayed at a standstill over internet policy, the Supreme Court will hear arguments Monday in cases that could shake up a broad swath of the online landscape and define how lawmakers could regulate social media companies.\n\nThe two cases stem from challenges to laws in Texas and Florida that would restrict how the largest social media sites and other online platforms moderate their content and require them to explain to an account holder whenever they do remove or alter a post.\n\nThe states have argued the laws would prevent online platforms from discriminating against anyone online based on their viewpoints and ensure transparency in the content moderation process for social media platforms that carry much of public discourse nationwide.\n\nTexas and Florida enacted the laws as part of conservative backlash to perceived \"censorship\" of conservative views by major social media platforms, and they included requirements that those sites have detailed explanation and appeals process when people are blocked.\n\n-CQ-Roll Call\n\nDefense says cellphone data raise questions about start of Willis-Wade relationship\n\nATLANTA - Nathan Wade appeared to make at least 35 visits to the Hapeville neighborhood where Fani Willis was living before the district attorney hired him to lead Fulton County's election interference prosecution, according to cellphone data included in a court submission filed Friday.\n\nThe filing, by attorneys for Donald Trump, raises fresh questions about the relationship between the two prosecutors, which the former president and other defendants argue has tainted the case against them and should result in Willis and her office being disqualified.\n\nTrump's lawyers relied on data collected from Wade's cellphone and cellphone tower transmissions that they said tracked his movements. However, at least one expert interviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution questioned the accuracy of the cellphone data findings.\n\nIf they are correct, they could contradict Wade's testimony last week in which he said he had visited Willis at her condo in Hapeville no more than 10 times before he was hired in November 2021. It also indicates Wade twice arrived in the area late at night and left early the next morning in the months before Willis and Wade said their relationship became romantic early in 2022.\n\n-The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\nThe Atlantic is record-warm right now. What does that mean for hurricane season?\n\nTAMPA, Fla. - Hurricane season is still months away, but warm winter waters in the Atlantic Ocean are already concerning some forecasters.\n\nWater temperatures in the north Atlantic Ocean currently rival those normally seen during the summer months. By some estimates, this type of heat would only be seen once every 142,000 years.\n\nResearchers say we are reaching the Atlantic Ocean's winter peak - the first week of March typically marks the coldest water temperatures of the year and experts say the unseasonably warm waters will only get hotter after that.\n\nOn Florida's west coast, the Gulf of Mexico has cooled off after a blistering summer that recorded hot tub-like temperatures. While a strong El Ni\u00f1o was responsible for warming Gulf waters just a few months ago, it has also boosted winter storms, whipping up winds and lowering surface temperatures. But experts expect that as the summer approaches and El Ni\u00f1o wanes, Gulf waters will warm up again.\n\n-Tampa Bay Times\n\nRussian defector's murder in resort catches Spain off guard\n\nSpain expressed concern over the killing of a Russian military deserter in a popular tourist resort, though stopped short of pointing the finger at the Kremlin's security services as the government awaits the forensic report.\n\nMaxim Kuzminov, a former Russian air-force captain who defected to Ukraine last year, was shot dead earlier this month in Alicante, southeast Spain. A Ukrainian military intelligence spokesman confirmed his killing, without giving further details. A top Russian intelligence official referred to Kuzminov as a \"moral corpse\" because of his actions.\n\nEl Pais, Spain's largest newspaper, reported on Thursday that local intelligence services are linking the murder to the Russian government and suspect the killers came from outside the country.\n\nSpanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said in an interview late yesterday that the matter \"needs to be treated with a lot of care,\" adding that the government is in contact with the Russian ambassador in Madrid. \"Of course the possibility that a person could be murdered on Spanish soil in this context is something we take very seriously,\" he told Bloomberg in New York.\n\n-Bloomberg News",

        "body": "By John E. Hoover Sports Illustrated Oklahoma Sooners News, Analysis and More\n\n]Oklahoma's bats exploded, and the Sooners got a dominant start on the mound.\n\nThat was the right combination for an OU rout on Friday at L. Dale Mitchell Park as Oklahoma opened its home schedule by pounding Wright State 20-0 in Norman.\n\nThe Sooners improved to 3-2 on the season, while Wright State fell to 1-3.\n\nLeft-hander Braden Davis pitched six shutout innings and allowed only three hits and a walk while striking out eight of the 23 batters he faced. He threw 92 pitches, including 55 strikes, and lowered his season ERA to 0.82.\n\nDavis had plenty of support at the plate as the Sooners racked up a season-high 21 hits.\n\nSnyder's sacrifice fly to right center brought home Spikerman for a 7-0 lead in the fourth, but the Sooners were only getting started.\n\nSix runs came across in the fifth, starting with Spikerman's two-run single to right that scored Mudler and Pettis for a 9-0 lead. Easton Carmichael's double to left allowed Spikerman to score for a 10-0 lead, and Snyder's double to right moved Carmichael to third and scored Madron to put the Sooners up 11-0. Nicklaus' double to left sent Carmichael home for a 12-0 lead, and Mackenzie made it 13-0 with an RBI groundout that scored Snyder.\n\nOU added four in the seventh when Dasan Harris bounced a two-out grounder on the infield -- his first collegiate hit -- and drove home Carter Frederick to make it 14-0. Mudler then ran it up with a three-run home run to right field for a 17-0 lead.\n\nAfter Wright State left hander Joey Valentine walked the bases loaded in the eighth, Isaiah Lane delivered his first collegiate hit with a three-run triple off the right field wall for a 20-0 lead. It was OU's first 20-spot since 2022.\n\nSpikerman went 3-for-3 with two RBIs and three runs scored, while Mudler was 3-for-5 with three RBIs and three runs and Madron was 2-for-4 with three RBIs and three runs. Snyder was 3-for-4 with three RBIs and a run scored, and Nicklaus had two hits and two RBIs. Pettis had two hits and two runs, Lane had three RBIs and Mackenzie had two RBIs. Only one OU starter didn't record a hit.\n\nJett Lodes relieved Davis and recorded four strikeouts in a scoreless seventh and eighth.\n\nMyles Meyer pitched the ninth and added a strikeout, giving the Sooners at least 13 strikeouts in each of their first five games, but Meyer also gave up a double and two walks to load the bases before Brad Pruett closed things out with another pair of strikeouts, their 15th.\n\nFriday's blowout was the first of a four-game series. The team meet again on Saturday with a 1 p.m. doubleheader, then finish the series at 2 p.m. Sunday. All games can be seen on ESPN+.",

The Dynamo will also be without star midfielder Hector Herrera (undisclosed surgical procedure).\n\nForward Corey Baird departed as a free agent after last season while defender Griffin Dorsey opted to stick with the Dynamo.\n\nHouston recently re-signed midfielder Adalberto \"Coco\" Carrasquilla through the 2025 season with the club also holding two option seasons.\n\nCarrasquilla, 25, had three goals and eight assists last season. He's counting on the Dynamo equaling last season's success.\n\n\"Last year, our team proved that the Houston Dynamo can once again be true contenders in MLS,\" Carrasquilla said. \"... We have been working hard all preseason and hope to build a strong campaign for the upcoming year.\"\n\nThat Sporting Kansas City (12-14-8, 44 points) was in the Western Conference semifinals was quite the accomplishment as the club went 0-7-3 through its first 10 matches.\n\nSporting KC won six of their final nine regular-season matches to crash the field.\n\nMLS Comeback Player of the Year Alan Pulido (14 goals) will again pace the attack. The forward missed the entire 2022 season due to a knee injury.\n\nSporting KC added midfielder Memo Rodriguez while the departures included two long-time stalwart midfielders in Graham Zusi (15 seasons with SKC) and midfielder Roger Espinoza (14 seasons).\n\nVeteran forward Johnny Russell and goalkeeper Tim Melia are still around as part of the club's old guard.\n\nThe club has two designated player openings and SKC coach Peter Vermes said the search is ongoing.\n\n\"We're still looking and trying to make sure it's the right fit,\" Vermes said.",

Knapp also posted a 64, Wallace a 65 and Valimaki a 67 in the second round.

The highlight came at the par-5 sixth hole, when his downhill, right-to-left eagle putt dropped from 30 feet away. Ortiz drove all 13 fairways in regulation.\n\nLike Ortiz, Knapp stayed bogey-free with his round and sank seven birdies. He tied for third at the Farmers Insurance Open last month.\n\nDefending champion Tony Finau shot a 67 on Friday to join a massive group in ninth at 6 under.

        "title": "This weekend's full moon will be a 'micromoon.' Here's what that means",
        "body": "February's full moon, known as the snow moon, is set to peak on Saturday, shining bright around the world in the night sky.Related video above: Full moons: When are they and what are their names?The moon will be at its most full at 7:30 a.m. ET Saturday, according to EarthSky, but to the human eye, the moon will appear full for a couple of days, so the best time to view it will be the nights before and after its peak.While called the snow moon, the golden orb will look almost like any ordinary full moon. But this moon will be a micromoon, meaning it might look slightly smaller than usual.\"It's just a little bit farther away from Earth than (the moon) typically is,\" said Rachel Klima, a planetary geologist and lunar expert with Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.\"It's about 10% smaller. So it may look a little bit smaller. But a lot of the time, when people see a really huge moon, it's usually because it's low on the horizon, rather than because of the actual distance of it,\" Klima said. \"(The micromoon) won't be super, super tiny. It'll just be a little bit smaller than your average full moon that you look up at.\"The full moon phase occurs when the moon, Earth and the sun are in alignment, in that order. February's full moon will occur when the moon is at its farthest point from Earth in its elliptical orbit, known as the apogee, Klima said. The micromoon will also be dimmer than the moon typically looks by about 30%, according to EarthSky, allowing for slightly better visibility of nearby celestial objects, without the average luminous interference.This year, the snow moon will shine next to the constellation Leo's brightest star, Regulus. Near the moon's peak, on the night of Feb. 23, the star will be seen just below the orb, according to EarthSky.You obviously don't need any special equipment to enjoy moon-gazing, but binoculars can be a good tool for those looking to see its features and craters clearly, Klima said. While full moons are best observed in clear skies, even in slightly cloudy weather the moon will occasionally peek through the clouds, she added.Lunar explorationOn Thursday, the Odysseus lunar lander successfully soft-landed near the moon's south pole, accomplishing a feat that had not been attempted by any vehicle launched from the United States since the Apollo program ended more than five decades ago. Intuitive Machines' IM-1 mission also marked the first commercial spacecraft to soft-land on the moon amid a renewed international dash for the lunar surface.\"The nice thing to kind of dream about when you look up at the moon right now is how much renewed activity there is internationally,\" Klima said. \"We're basically opening up a new era of lunar exploration. ... As these different companies start to land on the moon, we're going to be able to learn much, much more and really have this whole new world -- economic world and scientific world -- opened up to us.\"More full moons this yearOf the 12 full moons in 2024, February's full moon is the only micromoon of the year, while the September and October lunar events will be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky.Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger and brighter in the night sky. Some astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee -- its closest approach to Earth in orbit.Here are the remaining full moons of 2024:March 25: Worm moon April 23: Pink moon May 23: Flower moon June 21: Strawberry moon July 21: Buck moon Aug. 19: Sturgeon moon Sept. 17: Harvest moon Oct. 17: Hunter's moon Nov. 15: Beaver moon Dec. 15: Cold moon Solar and lunar eclipsesMultiple eclipses will occur in 2024.The most highly anticipated of these events is the total solar eclipse on April 8, which will be visible in parts of Mexico, the United States and Canada. A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, completely blocking the sun's face.Those within the path of totality, or locations where the moon's shadow will completely cover the sun, will see a total solar eclipse. People outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse in which the moon only obscures part of the sun's face.A total solar eclipse won't be visible across the contiguous United States again until August 2044.An annular solar eclipse will occur on Oct. 2 over parts of South America. This type of eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, except the moon is at the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, so it can't completely block the sun. Instead, annular solar eclipses create a \"ring of fire\" in the sky as the sun's fiery light surrounds the moon's shadow.Meanwhile, a penumbral lunar eclipse will be visible to many across Europe, North and East Asia, Australia, Africa, North America and South America between March 24 and 25.A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when the sun, Earth and moon align so that the moon passes into Earth's shadow. A penumbral lunar eclipse is more subtle and happens when the moon moves through the outer shadow, or penumbra, of Earth.A partial lunar eclipse, in which Earth moves between the sun and the full moon without being perfectly aligned, will appear over Europe and much of Asia, Africa, North America and South America between Sept. 17 and 18.Check Time and Date's website to see when each of these eclipses will appear.Meteor showers of 2024Sky-gazers can look forward to a multitude of meteor showers this year, according to the American Meteor Society.

But this moon will be a micromoon, meaning it might look slightly smaller than usual.\"It's just a little bit farther away from Earth than (the moon) typically is,\" said Rachel Klima, a planetary geologist and lunar expert with Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.\"It's about 10% smaller. So it may look a little bit smaller. But a lot of the time, when people see a really huge moon, it's usually because it's low on the horizon, rather than because of the actual distance of it,\" Klima said. \"(The micromoon) won't be super, super tiny. It'll just be a little bit smaller than your average full moon that you look up at.\"The full moon phase occurs when the moon, Earth and the sun are in alignment, in that order. February's full moon will occur when the moon is at its farthest point from Earth in its elliptical orbit, known as the apogee, Klima said. The micromoon will also be dimmer than the moon typically looks by about 30%, according to EarthSky, allowing for slightly better visibility of nearby celestial objects, without the average luminous interference.This year, the snow moon will shine next to the constellation Leo's brightest star, Regulus. Near the moon's peak, on the night of Feb. 23, the star will be seen just below the orb, according to EarthSky.You obviously don't need any special equipment to enjoy moon-gazing, but binoculars can be a good tool for those looking to see its features and craters clearly, Klima said. While full moons are best observed in clear skies, even in slightly cloudy weather the moon will occasionally peek through the clouds, she added.Lunar explorationOn Thursday, the Odysseus lunar lander successfully soft-landed near the moon's south pole, accomplishing a feat that had not been attempted by any vehicle launched from the United States since the Apollo program ended more than five decades ago. Intuitive Machines' IM-1 mission also marked the first commercial spacecraft to soft-land on the moon amid a renewed international dash for the lunar surface.\"The nice thing to kind of dream about when you look up at the moon right now is how much renewed activity there is internationally,\" Klima said. \"We're basically opening up a new era of lunar exploration. ... As these different companies start to land on the moon, we're going to be able to learn much, much more and really have this whole new world -- economic world and scientific world -- opened up to us.\"More full moons this yearOf the 12 full moons in 2024, February's full moon is the only micromoon of the year, while the September and October lunar events will be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky.Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger and brighter in the night sky. Some astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee -- its closest approach to Earth in orbit.Here are the remaining full moons of 2024:March 25: Worm moon April 23: Pink moon May 23: Flower moon June 21: Strawberry moon July 21: Buck moon Aug. 19: Sturgeon moon Sept. 17: Harvest moon Oct. 17: Hunter's moon Nov. 15: Beaver moon Dec. 15: Cold moon Solar and lunar eclipsesMultiple eclipses will occur in 2024.The most highly anticipated of these events is the total solar eclipse on April 8, which will be visible in parts of Mexico, the United States and Canada. A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, completely blocking the sun's face.Those within the path of totality, or locations where the moon's shadow will completely cover the sun, will see a total solar eclipse. People outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse in which the moon only obscures part of the sun's face.A total solar eclipse won't be visible across the contiguous United States again until August 2044.An annular solar eclipse will occur on Oct. 2 over parts of South America. This type of eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, except the moon is at the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, so it can't completely block the sun. Instead, annular solar eclipses create a \"ring of fire\" in the sky as the sun's fiery light surrounds the moon's shadow.Meanwhile, a penumbral lunar eclipse will be visible to many across Europe, North and East Asia, Australia, Africa, North America and South America between March 24 and 25.A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when the sun, Earth and moon align so that the moon passes into Earth's shadow. A penumbral lunar eclipse is more subtle and happens when the moon moves through the outer shadow, or penumbra, of Earth.A partial lunar eclipse, in which Earth moves between the sun and the full moon without being perfectly aligned, will appear over Europe and much of Asia, Africa, North America and South America between Sept. 17 and 18.Check Time and Date's website to see when each of these eclipses will appear.Meteor showers of 2024Sky-gazers can look forward to a multitude of meteor showers this year, according to the American Meteor Society.

        "body": "Bitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms recorded a 19% increase in the number of Bitcoins (BTC) produced in 2023, mining a total of 6,626 Bitcoins. The firm also saw an uptick in annual revenue, mainly due to the higher average price of Bitcoin throughout 2023 compared to the previous year's bear market.\n\nAccording to a February 22 report published by Riot Platforms, the average cost for the firm to mine a single Bitcoin in 2023 decreased by approximately $3,686 compared to 2022.\n\n\"Riot's cost to mine Bitcoin for 2023, net of power credits allocated to self-mining, averaged $7,539 per Bitcoin versus $11,225 in 2022, a decrease of 33% year-over-year,\" the report stated.\n\nAdditionally, the average value of Bitcoin in 2023 surpassed that of 2022, resulting in a revenue increase for the year, amounting to $280.7 million, compared to the previous year's $259.2 million.\n\n\"The increase in Bitcoin Mining revenue was driven by slightly higher values of Bitcoin mined in 2023, which averaged $28,859 per Bitcoin as compared to an average price of $28,245 per Bitcoin in 2022.\"\n\nIn 2022, the crypto market experienced one of its most severe bear markets, with the collapse of several crypto firms, including major exchange FTX.\n\nOver the past month, Riot's stock price surged by 47.47%. However, last week, it declined approximately 10.65% over the 5-day trading period.\n\nAt the time of publication, Riot's stock price is $14.85.\n\nIn December 2023, Cointelegraph reported that Riot acquired 66,560 mining rigs from manufacturer MicroBT, marking one of the largest expansions of hash rate in the firm's history ahead of the Bitcoin halving scheduled for April this year.\n\nIn 2023, other Bitcoin mining firms recorded a range of results. Core Scientific produced 19,274 Bitcoins, and CleanSpark saw a 60% surge compared to 2022, mining over 7,300 Bitcoins during the year.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin mining difficulty surpasses 80 trillion ahead of halving\n\nMeanwhile, Marathon Digital reported 12,852 Bitcoins in 2023. Additionally, it mined 1,853 Bitcoin in December, a 56% increase from November and a 290% increase from December 2022.\n\nIn more recent news, Riot along with the Texas Blockchain Council filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \"invasive\" data collection from crypto miners.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Navy today awarded HII a $1.2 billion contract to begin the engineering overhaul on the Los Angeles-class submarine Boise (SSN-764), a boat that has been sidelined for years due to the service's ongoing maintenance backlog, according to the Pentagon's daily contract announcements.\n\nThe work will be done at HII's Newport News Shipbuilding in Norfolk, Va., and the award allows for maintenance to begin \"immediately,\" according to the company.\n\n\"The NNS team looks forward to leveraging our experience in nuclear-powered submarine maintenance to begin this important engineering overhaul (EOH) of USS Boise (SSN 764),\" Todd Corillo, an HII spokesman, said in a statement to Breaking Defense. \"The contract covers work that will include maintenance and restoration of the ship's hull structure, tanks, propulsion systems, electric plant, auxiliary systems, armament and furnishings, as well as numerous ship alterations.\"\n\nOriginally launched in 1991, Boise has sat in port since 2017 due to a series of delays that denied it a timely availability at a public shipyard. If the Navy's expectation of work being completed by September 2029 holds, that means there is a potential 12 year gap between missions for the Boise, a nuclear-powered, fast-attack sub.\n\nIn May 2020, Corillo said, the sub was sent to Newport News Shipbuilding for associated work to \"de-risk the overhaul,\" or in other words, provide HII the opportunity to identify ahead of time any unexpected issues that might need to be resolved during the long anticipated engineering overhaul.\n\nBoise's excessive delays have been repeatedly cited by lawmakers such as Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed, D-R.I., as the \"poster child\" for the Navy's ship maintenance backlog.\n\nAlthough submarine maintenance is traditionally handled by one of the service's public shipyards, the Navy has taken to tapping private industry in an effort to alleviate its maintenance backlog.\n\nAs the Navy's senior acquisition executive, Nickolas Guertin, who was nominated to his position in 2022 but only recently assumed his office following a political impasse over military nominations in the Senate, is largely responsible for the service's sub maintenance and contracting.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing in March 2023, he said he would \"aggressively pursue any method we can\" to resolve the backlog.",

        "body": "By John E. Hoover Sports Illustrated Oklahoma Sooners News, Analysis and More\n\n]Oklahoma's bats exploded, and the Sooners got a dominant start on the mound.\n\nThat was the right combination for an OU rout on Friday at L. Dale Mitchell Park as Oklahoma opened its home schedule by pounding Wright State 20-0 in Norman.\n\nThe Sooners improved to 3-2 on the season, while Wright State fell to 1-3.\n\nLeft-hander Braden Davis pitched six shutout innings and allowed only three hits and a walk while striking out eight of the 23 batters he faced. He threw 92 pitches, including 55 strikes, and lowered his season ERA to 0.82.\n\nDavis had plenty of support at the plate as the Sooners racked up a season-high 21 hits.\n\nSnyder's sacrifice fly to right center brought home Spikerman for a 7-0 lead in the fourth, but the Sooners were only getting started.\n\nSix runs came across in the fifth, starting with Spikerman's two-run single to right that scored Mudler and Pettis for a 9-0 lead. Easton Carmichael's double to left allowed Spikerman to score for a 10-0 lead, and Snyder's double to right moved Carmichael to third and scored Madron to put the Sooners up 11-0. Nicklaus' double to left sent Carmichael home for a 12-0 lead, and Mackenzie made it 13-0 with an RBI groundout that scored Snyder.\n\nOU added four in the seventh when Dasan Harris bounced a two-out grounder on the infield -- his first collegiate hit -- and drove home Carter Frederick to make it 14-0. Mudler then ran it up with a three-run home run to right field for a 17-0 lead.\n\nAfter Wright State left hander Joey Valentine walked the bases loaded in the eighth, Isaiah Lane delivered his first collegiate hit with a three-run triple off the right field wall for a 20-0 lead. It was OU's first 20-spot since 2022.\n\nSpikerman went 3-for-3 with two RBIs and three runs scored, while Mudler was 3-for-5 with three RBIs and three runs and Madron was 2-for-4 with three RBIs and three runs. Snyder was 3-for-4 with three RBIs and a run scored, and Nicklaus had two hits and two RBIs. Pettis had two hits and two runs, Lane had three RBIs and Mackenzie had two RBIs. Only one OU starter didn't record a hit.\n\nJett Lodes relieved Davis and recorded four strikeouts in a scoreless seventh and eighth.\n\nMyles Meyer pitched the ninth and added a strikeout, giving the Sooners at least 13 strikeouts in each of their first five games, but Meyer also gave up a double and two walks to load the bases before Brad Pruett closed things out with another pair of strikeouts, their 15th.\n\nFriday's blowout was the first of a four-game series. The team meet again on Saturday with a 1 p.m. doubleheader, then finish the series at 2 p.m. Sunday. All games can be seen on ESPN+.",

        "body": "TERESA M. WALKER and RALPH D. RUSSO Associated Press\n\nThe NCAA lost another legal battle Friday as a federal judge barred the organization from enforcing its rules prohibiting name, image and likeness compensation for recruits by granting a preliminary injunction demanded by the states of Tennessee and Virginia.\n\nIt was another blow to the NCAA's ability to govern college sports and more than 500,000 athletes.\n\nGabe Feldman, a sports law professor at Tulane, said an act of Congress might save the NCAA even as he noted this was just a preliminary injunction in one district court with the NCAA expected to appeal. That would go to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overseeing Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio and Michigan.\n\n\"There's no question the NCAA has never faced more attacks from different areas at one time,\" Feldman said. \"And things are snowballing. And I think that's why there are so many serious discussions about how college sports needs to change and what those changes will look like.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nStatesville woman killed in head-on crash on Salisbury Highway Hickory man killed in crash on Interstate 40 in Iredell County Saturday HIGH SCHOOL WRESTLING: Three Iredell wrestlers crowned state champs Amalfi's ready for spotlight after visit from 'America's Best Restaurants' 2-year-old dies after being struck by car in North Carolina.

The judge said athletes with a limited window are hurt by not being able to know their true value before committing to a school.\n\nThe decision led to questions about whether boosters will suddenly open the floodgates with offers to potential recruits. Oklahoma State athletic director Chad Weinberg said the Cowboys had anticipated the decision but \"we are awaiting further guidance from the Big 12 Conference and NCAA.\"\n\nThe NCAA said it would review the ruling and talk with its member schools about possible policy changes. But the NCAA said turning rules supported by its members \"upside down\" will only make an already chaotic situation worse and lessen protections keeping athletes from being exploited.\n\n\"An endless patchwork of state laws and court opinions make clear partnering with Congress is necessary to provide stability for the future of all college athletes,\" the NCAA said in its statement on the same day NCAA President Charlie Baker discussed the situation on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"I think in the end, we are going to need Congress to do something,\" Baker said. \"Because people will draw a lot of conclusions from court decisions. And then there will be new ones.\"\n\nHelen Drew, a professor of sports law at the University of Buffalo, said Baker is not identifying any specific bill for Congress. She also said this all is accelerating quickly after the NCAA did virtually nothing for years.\n\n\"Why have they not been addressing this?\" Drew said. \"The model's falling apart.'\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe attorneys general of Tennessee and Virginia filed a federal lawsuit on Jan. 31 challenging the NCAA's NIL rules after it was revealed the University of Tennessee was under investigation for potential infractions.\n\nThey argued that since the NCAA lifted its ban on athletes being permitted to cash in on their fame in 2021 recruits are factoring in NIL opportunities when they choose a school -- decisions that should not be limited. The judge noted the NCAA's contention that allowing so-called NIL collectives -- business entities backed by boosters -- to strike deals with recruits would eviscerate the difference between college athletics and professional sports.\n\n\"While the NCAA permits student-athletes to profit from their NIL, it fails to show how the timing of when a student-athlete enters such an agreement would destroy the goal of preserving amateurism,\" the judge wrote.\n\nCorker has made clear he believed the states are likely to prevail in the long run.\n\nTennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said the injunction ensures athlete rights will be protected from the NCAA's \"illegal NIL-recruitment ban.\" He said the bigger fight continues.\n\n\"We will litigate this case to the fullest extent necessary to ensure the NCAA's monopoly cannot continue to harm Tennessee student-athletes,\" Skrmetti said. \"The NCAA is not above the law, and the law is on our side.\"\n\nVirginia Attorney General Jason Miyares called the injunction a significant ruling for athletes who deserve the freedom to negotiate and benefit as the NCAA and its member schools earn millions.\n\n\"It's only fair that they have more freedom over what they earn,\" he said. \"The NCAA has taken advantage of talented young athletes for too long.\"\n\nJoshua Lens, an assistant professor at the University of Arkansas and former college athletics administrator, called this lawsuit and the judge's order very specific. Lens said the NCAA still can enforce its other NIL rules. Whether this becomes a national precedent depends on the NCAA's response.\n\nThe NCAA already is not enforcing certain transfer rules after a federal judge's ruling in December.\n\n\"I think the NCAA is just going to pause for a minute on trying to enforce the so called NIL recruiting ban,\" Lens said.\n\nThe injunction helps the University of Tennessee, which is facing an inquiry by the NCAA into possible recruiting violations. University officials declined to comment Friday but its chancellor revealed Jan. 30 in a scathing letter to Baker that the association was alleging Tennessee violated NIL rules through deals made between athletes and a booster-funded NIL collective that supports Volunteers athletes. Donde Plowman called it \"intellectually dishonest\" for NCAA staff to pursue infractions cases as if students have no NIL rights.\n\nThe NCAA's authority to regulate compensation for athletes has been under attack from a variety of avenues and its legal woes are growing.\n\nThe Tennessee case is one of at least six antitrust lawsuits the NCAA is defending as it also asks for antitrust protections from Congress. A National Labor Relations Board official ruled in early February that members of the Dartmouth men's basketball team are employees of the school and could vote to form a union, which the players plan to do.\n\n0 Comments Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

        "title": "Ukraine on the defensive as Russia war enters third year",
        "body": "Ukraine on Saturday marked two years since Russia's invasion, entering a new year of war weakened by a lack of western aid while Russia is emboldened by fresh gains.\n\nWhen Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" at dawn on February 24, 2022, many expected Moscow's victory within days, but Ukraine fought back, forcing Russian troops into humiliating retreats.\n\nBut Ukraine has suffered setbacks with the failure of its 2023 counteroffensive. The Russian army has in turn built up a position of strength thanks to booming war production, while Ukraine's troops are short of manpower and running low on Western-supplied ammunition for artillery and air defences.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that decisions on arms supplies have to be \"the priority\".\n\nSaturday's anniversary will see visits by Western leaders including EU commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, but the overall picture remains bleak for Kyiv due to the US Congress blocking a vital $60 billion aid package. This has come on top of delays in promised European deliveries.\n\nUS President Joe Biden renewed calls for Republican lawmakers to unblock the additional funding, warning that \"history is waiting\" and \"failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will not be forgotten\".\n\n- 'War is our life' -\n\nRussia is attacking hard in the east, with the destroyed town of Maryinka near Donetsk the latest hotspot after it captured the heavily fortified town of Avdiivka on February 17.\n\nUkraine's economy has also been hit by a border blockade by Polish farmers that Kyiv says threatens exports and has held up deliveries of weapons.\n\nIn Kyiv, the mood was grim but still defiant as people said they had grown accustomed to wartime conditions.\n\n\"For women of Ukraine, this is our heartache -- for our husbands, for our children, for our fathers,\" said nutritionist Olga Byrko in Kyiv.\n\n\"I would really like this to end as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"Yes of course we have learned to live with it... now the war is our life,\" said Yuriy Pasichnyk, a 38-year-old businessman.\n\n\"I think we need to have more weapons so that we can drive this evil spirit out of our land and start rebuilding our Ukraine,\" said 51-year-old Kostyantyn Gofman.\n\nUkraine needs almost half a trillion dollars to rebuild towns and cities destroyed by Russia's invasion, according to the latest estimate by the World Bank, European Union, United Nations and Ukrainian government.\n\nUkraine has estimated that around 50,000 civilians have been killed.\n\n- 'Running out of shells' -\n\nNeither side has given numbers for military deaths and injured, while both claim to have inflicted huge losses.\n\nIn August 2023, The New York Times quoted US officials as putting Ukraine's military losses at 70,000 dead and 100,000 to 120,000 injured.\n\nLeaked US intelligence in December indicated that 315,000 Russian troops had been killed or wounded.\n\nOn the eastern front, morale is low as outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian troops are ceding ground to Russian forces.\n\n\"We are running out of shells and the Russians keep coming. Lots of our comrades are injured -- or worse. Everything is getting worse and worse,\" said one soldier near Bakhmut, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nMoscow has massively ramped up its arms production and received drones from Iran, while Kyiv says it has confirmed Russia's use of North Korean missiles.\n\nZelensky said in December the military wanted to draft up to 500,000 more troops. A bill to broaden mobilisation has caused wide public fear.\n\nThe conflict has thrown Russia into even greater isolation from the West, with the United States and its allies imposing a slew of sanctions.\n\nBut Putin has brushed off the fallout and hailed the troops as \"true national heroes\".\n\nHe has used the war years to rally patriotism and mount an even harsher crackdown on dissent, with few daring to voice opposition to the war.\n\nThe death in prison of opposition leader Alexei Navalny has removed Putin's arch-foe, and he is set to extend his term in office in elections next month.\n\nOn the streets of Moscow, most people told AFP they back the soldiers fighting in Ukraine.\n\n\"I'm proud of our men,\" said 27-year-old Nadezhda, an environmental engineer.\n\n\"Of course I am anxious for them, but it's a pleasant feeling that they are doing great, they are out there fighting for our country.\"\n\nOne of the few to give an alternative opinion, was Konstantin, a drama teacher working as a waiter, who said: \"I'm against any war. Two years have passed and it annoys me that people can't talk to each other and are still at war.\"\n\nbur/tw/smw\n\nOriginally published as Ukraine on the defensive as Russia war enters third year",

        "title": "OU Baseball: Oklahoma Opens Home Season by Crushing Wright State",
        "body": "By John E. Hoover Sports Illustrated Oklahoma Sooners News, Analysis and More\n\n]Oklahoma's bats exploded, and the Sooners got a dominant start on the mound.\n\nThat was the right combination for an OU rout on Friday at L. Dale Mitchell Park as Oklahoma opened its home schedule by pounding Wright State 20-0 in Norman.\n\nThe Sooners improved to 3-2 on the season, while Wright State fell to 1-3.\n\nLeft-hander Braden Davis pitched six shutout innings and allowed only three hits and a walk while striking out eight of the 23 batters he faced. He threw 92 pitches, including 55 strikes, and lowered his season ERA to 0.82.\n\nDavis had plenty of support at the plate as the Sooners racked up a season-high 21 hits.\n\nSnyder's sacrifice fly to right center brought home Spikerman for a 7-0 lead in the fourth, but the Sooners were only getting started.\n\nSix runs came across in the fifth, starting with Spikerman's two-run single to right that scored Mudler and Pettis for a 9-0 lead. Easton Carmichael's double to left allowed Spikerman to score for a 10-0 lead, and Snyder's double to right moved Carmichael to third and scored Madron to put the Sooners up 11-0. Nicklaus' double to left sent Carmichael home for a 12-0 lead, and Mackenzie made it 13-0 with an RBI groundout that scored Snyder.\n\nOU added four in the seventh when Dasan Harris bounced a two-out grounder on the infield -- his first collegiate hit -- and drove home Carter Frederick to make it 14-0. Mudler then ran it up with a three-run home run to right field for a 17-0 lead.\n\nAfter Wright State left hander Joey Valentine walked the bases loaded in the eighth, Isaiah Lane delivered his first collegiate hit with a three-run triple off the right field wall for a 20-0 lead. It was OU's first 20-spot since 2022.\n\nSpikerman went 3-for-3 with two RBIs and three runs scored, while Mudler was 3-for-5 with three RBIs and three runs and Madron was 2-for-4 with three RBIs and three runs. Snyder was 3-for-4 with three RBIs and a run scored, and Nicklaus had two hits and two RBIs. Pettis had two hits and two runs, Lane had three RBIs and Mackenzie had two RBIs. Only one OU starter didn't record a hit.\n\nJett Lodes relieved Davis and recorded four strikeouts in a scoreless seventh and eighth.\n\nMyles Meyer pitched the ninth and added a strikeout, giving the Sooners at least 13 strikeouts in each of their first five games, but Meyer also gave up a double and two walks to load the bases before Brad Pruett closed things out with another pair of strikeouts, their 15th.\n\nFriday's blowout was the first of a four-game series. The team meet again on Saturday with a 1 p.m. doubleheader, then finish the series at 2 p.m. Sunday. All games can be seen on ESPN+.",

The balloon was intercepted by NORAD fighters over Utah, who determined it was not maneuverable and did not present a threat to national security. NORAD will continue to track and monitor the balloon. The FAA also determined the balloon posed no hazard to flight safety. NORAD remains in close coordination with the FAA to ensure flight safety.\"\n\nTwo U.S. officials reportedly confirmed to Fox News that a high-altitude balloon was over the Western U.S., but did not yet know the origin or purpose of the balloon.\n\nThe official said the balloon was drifting east on the jetstream, according to Fox News's report.\n\nThe news comes just over a year after the U.S. tracked a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon in American airspace for a couple of days in February 2023.\n\nA senior defense official told Pentagon reporters that the U.S. has \"very high confidence\" it is a Chinese high-altitude balloon and it was flying over sensitive sites to collect information. One of the places the balloon was spotted was Montana, which is home to one of the nation's three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON - Democrats were outraged in 2020 when Republicans pushed through a replacement for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg shortly before the presidential election, calling it one of the darkest days in the Senate's history.\n\nBut the first justice to call Amy Coney Barrett to congratulate her on the Senate's confirmation vote was one of her new liberal colleagues, Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nBarrett, the third nominee chosen by President Donald Trump, was at the White House when Sotomayor called her cell phone to welcome her to the \"family.\"\n\nAnd when Barrett arrived at the court a few weeks later, not knowing how she would be received, Sotomayor appeared at her office laden with Halloween candy for Barrett's children.\n\nIt's such small gestures of kindness and concern, Barrett said Friday, that make the court a more collegial place than a polarized public may think.\n\n\"There are so many, many things that you can do to bring the temperature down,\" Sotomayor said as part of a discussion the pair had at the National Governors Association winter meeting on respectfully navigating disagreements. \"When we disagree, our pens are sharp. But on a personal level, we never translate that into our relationships with one another.\"\n\nTheir discussion Friday was part of a yearlong initiative by the National Governors Association to help both voters and elected officials learn the skills of \"healthy conflict.\"\n\n\"There's an exhausted majority of Americans who are fed up with divisive rhetoric and feel their voices are drowned out by louder extremes,\" said Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, this year's chair of the association.\n\nThe justices may need lots of candy, movie nights, and lunches together to get through the next few months when they will be deciding multiple politically charged cases.\n\nThey are weighing whether Trump can be tried on charges that he tried to steal the 2020 election and whether he can be kicked off the ballot for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nTwo years after overturning the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to an abortion, the justices are considering whether to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone and if hospitals can provide emergency abortions in states with strict abortion bans.\n\nThe court will also decide the fate of two gun-control rules and whether to uphold laws from Texas and Florida that Republicans in those states say are needed to stop the \"censorship\" of conservative voices on social media.\n\nAnd they're being asked to weigh in on the hot-button issue of state bans of gender-affirming care for transgender minors.\n\nAt the panel discussion, Barrett and Sotomayor were asked about none of those cases.\n\nNor were they asked about the ethics controversies that have rocked the court and contributed to its low public approval ratings.\n\nInstead, they talked about their regular lunches together, the occasional movie nights and how they all - as Barrett put it - \"wear the same color black robe.\"\n\n\"You hear so much about our deeply divided court, or the 6-3 court,\" she said. \"But when you looked at the docket for last year, I think that might have been true in five cases or so. The vast number of cases were unanimous or almost unanimous.\"\n\nBoth Barrett and Sotomayor said their lifetime appointments insulate them from being tied too closely to a president or a party.\n\n\"Thankfully for us, presidents don't last that long, right? There's eight years. So for us to be beholden to one of them is a little crazy,\" Sotomayor said to laughter from governors. \"No, seriously, there is built into the system a protection, which is lifetime appointment, that should give us the freedom to grow as we grow in the job as well.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Same black robe: Sotomayor and Barrett on why SCOTUS isn't as polarized as you may think",

        "body": "Supreme Court to hear arguments on online content moderation\n\nWASHINGTON - As Congress has largely stayed at a standstill over internet policy, the Supreme Court will hear arguments Monday in cases that could shake up a broad swath of the online landscape and define how lawmakers could regulate social media companies.\n\nThe two cases stem from challenges to laws in Texas and Florida that would restrict how the largest social media sites and other online platforms moderate their content and require them to explain to an account holder whenever they do remove or alter a post.\n\nThe states have argued the laws would prevent online platforms from discriminating against anyone online based on their viewpoints and ensure transparency in the content moderation process for social media platforms that carry much of public discourse nationwide.\n\nTexas and Florida enacted the laws as part of conservative backlash to perceived \"censorship\" of conservative views by major social media platforms, and they included requirements that those sites have detailed explanation and appeals process when people are blocked.\n\n-CQ-Roll Call\n\nDefense says cellphone data raise questions about start of Willis-Wade relationship\n\nATLANTA - Nathan Wade appeared to make at least 35 visits to the Hapeville neighborhood where Fani Willis was living before the district attorney hired him to lead Fulton County's election interference prosecution, according to cellphone data included in a court submission filed Friday.\n\nThe filing, by attorneys for Donald Trump, raises fresh questions about the relationship between the two prosecutors, which the former president and other defendants argue has tainted the case against them and should result in Willis and her office being disqualified.\n\nTrump's lawyers relied on data collected from Wade's cellphone and cellphone tower transmissions that they said tracked his movements. However, at least one expert interviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution questioned the accuracy of the cellphone data findings.\n\nIf they are correct, they could contradict Wade's testimony last week in which he said he had visited Willis at her condo in Hapeville no more than 10 times before he was hired in November 2021. It also indicates Wade twice arrived in the area late at night and left early the next morning in the months before Willis and Wade said their relationship became romantic early in 2022.\n\n-The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\nThe Atlantic is record-warm right now. What does that mean for hurricane season?\n\nTAMPA, Fla. - Hurricane season is still months away, but warm winter waters in the Atlantic Ocean are already concerning some forecasters.\n\nWater temperatures in the north Atlantic Ocean currently rival those normally seen during the summer months. By some estimates, this type of heat would only be seen once every 142,000 years.\n\nResearchers say we are reaching the Atlantic Ocean's winter peak - the first week of March typically marks the coldest water temperatures of the year and experts say the unseasonably warm waters will only get hotter after that.\n\nOn Florida's west coast, the Gulf of Mexico has cooled off after a blistering summer that recorded hot tub-like temperatures. While a strong El Ni\u00f1o was responsible for warming Gulf waters just a few months ago, it has also boosted winter storms, whipping up winds and lowering surface temperatures. But experts expect that as the summer approaches and El Ni\u00f1o wanes, Gulf waters will warm up again.\n\n-Tampa Bay Times\n\nRussian defector's murder in resort catches Spain off guard\n\nSpain expressed concern over the killing of a Russian military deserter in a popular tourist resort, though stopped short of pointing the finger at the Kremlin's security services as the government awaits the forensic report.\n\nMaxim Kuzminov, a former Russian air-force captain who defected to Ukraine last year, was shot dead earlier this month in Alicante, southeast Spain. A Ukrainian military intelligence spokesman confirmed his killing, without giving further details. A top Russian intelligence official referred to Kuzminov as a \"moral corpse\" because of his actions.\n\nEl Pais, Spain's largest newspaper, reported on Thursday that local intelligence services are linking the murder to the Russian government and suspect the killers came from outside the country.\n\nSpanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said in an interview late yesterday that the matter \"needs to be treated with a lot of care,\" adding that the government is in contact with the Russian ambassador in Madrid. \"Of course the possibility that a person could be murdered on Spanish soil in this context is something we take very seriously,\" he told Bloomberg in New York.\n\n-Bloomberg News",

        "body": "(The Hill) -- A stomach virus known as the norovirus is spreading across the Northeast region of the United States, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe three-week average positive tests for norovirus in the region reached 13.9 percent in recent weeks and held above a 10 percent positive rate since the middle of December 2023.\n\nWhile the Northeast is experiencing a high number of positive norovirus cases, CDC data show that other regions are seeing positive tests in recent weeks too. The South has 9.5 percent, the Midwest has hovered around 10 percent and the West has about 12 percent.\n\nNorovirus is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea and foodborne illness in the United States, the CDC said. People of all ages can become infected and the illness spreads \"very easily and quickly.\"\n\nThe CDC said that people can contract norovirus many times in their lifetime because there are many different types of the virus. Becoming infected with \"one type of norovirus may not protect you against other types,\" the advisory said.\n\nPeople may develop protection against specific types of norovirus, but it's not known how long a protection may last.\n\nOutbreaks occur most frequently during late fall, winter and early spring. Symptoms also include fever, headache, dehydration and body aches.\n\nThe CDC recommends washing your hands well with soap and water, cleaning and disinfecting surfaces with bleach, and washing laundry with hot water to prevent the spread of norovirus.\n\nThere are 19 to 21 million illnesses in the U.S. due to norovirus each year, most commonly between November and April. There are about 109,000 hospitalizations each year and 900 deaths, most commonly among older adults, the CDC said.",

March beans finished at a new contract low and the lowest mark for the lead month since the fall of 2020. March options also expired at the close, with the heavily traded (4k contracts) $11.40 puts in the money. Soymeal futures ended the day $3.30 to $3.40 weaker, for a weekly loss of $14.10. Soy oil futures were at their weakest mark since 2021 with another 19 to 22 point losses for Friday.\n\nThe weekly CoT data showed soybean spec traders added 4.7k new shorts vs 2.6k new longs for a 136.7k contract net long as of 2/20. The commercial soybean traders were 36.4k contracts net long after adding 37k new contracts nearly even on both sides during the week.

        "title": "NRA loses landmark trial over millions in wasted donor funds",
        "body": "By Ethan M Steinberg, Bloomberg News The Tribune Content Agency\n\nThe National Rifle Association and its longtime leader Wayne LaPierre were found liable for violating New York law with lavish spending of donor funds, denting the gun rights group's invincible aura after a six-week trial and years of embarrassing revelations in court.\n\nA jury in lower Manhattan concluded on Friday, its fifth day of deliberations, that the NRA misused its charitable assets under state law governing nonprofit organizations and that LaPierre breached his duty to the group by enriching himself in the process, including with flights to the Bahamas.\n\nThe verdict, capping a civil lawsuit that New York Attorney General Letitia James filed in 2020, is perhaps the biggest legal setback for the NRA since it was founded in 1871. It is especially resonant in an election year on a polarized American political landscape in which gun rights, crime and mass shootings are particularly heated. And it comes on the heels of a big win James scored last week against Donald Trump in her civil fraud case.\n\nBut the NRA case was most notable for showing the self-dealing and turmoil at the top of the once high-flying nonprofit. It played out after years in which the NRA saw a sharp decrease in its funds and membership and drew to a close as LaPierre retired at 74, citing health problems, following three decades as the face of the gun lobby.\n\n\"One of its biggest assets has been the perception of its strength,\" Ohio State University accounting professor Brian Mittendorf said of the group before the verdict. The allegations of corruption on display in open court for weeks on end could shake that perception, said Mittendorf, who has studied the organization's finances.\n\nFrom 2016, when the NRA helped elect Trump president, through 2022, its revenues fell more than 40% and member dues by half, according to court documents and filings with the Internal Revenue Service. At the same time, its legal fees multiplied by six, surpassing $40 million, and it has reduced spending on programs for its members.\n\nThe organization said it remains vital.\n\n\"The NRA has more than 4 million members and represents millions of other law-abiding gun owners,\" a spokesman said in a statement before the verdict. \"Our adversaries continue to predict the 'demise' of the NRA - in the face of landmark legal victories, legislative wins at every level, and a wave of grassroots support.\"\n\nThe extravagant spending was on display throughout the trial. It included $600,000 in private flights to the Bahamas alone, for LaPierre and his family, one adding up to $37,000. Testifying on and off for three days, he told the jury that his friend and NRA vendor David McKenzie paid for yacht outings. LaPierre splurged on $274,000 in boutique suits, all on an NRA vendor's dime.\n\nOne high point of the trial was the testimony of Oliver North, the conservative stalwart and former NRA president who says he was forced out after raising concerns about the spending. North testified that in 2019 he pushed for an outside audit of the NRA's finances but that LaPierre refused.\n\n\"I was absolutely stunned,\" North testified about the spending allegations. \"It's called corruption.\"\n\nDuring its deliberations the six-member jury requested 4,000 pages of documents. The jurors filed into the courtroom periodically to hear answers to questions they had sent to New York State Supreme Court Justice Joel Cohen as they waded through a long and detailed verdict sheet.\n\nLaPierre was a formidable power broker. In 2016 the NRA spent more on Trump than it had on any other candidate. Trump, the Republican front-runner in this year's presidential election, has leveraged gun rights as a potent campaign issue and often spoken at the NRA's annual convention. He promised an NRA crowd this month that \"no one will lay a finger on your firearms\" if he is elected.\n\nThe NRA forged \"a political identity around guns, where guns weren't seen as tools for recreation and defense, but instead as sort of symbols of their values and political beliefs,\" said Matthew Lacombe, a political science professor at Case Western Reserve University who researches the group.\n\nLaPierre's face was so valuable to the organization that it signed an agreement with him to continue using his name, signature and image after his retirement - at an annual cost of $500,000 to the group, court filings show. That agreement has since been stricken.\n\nDespite the verdict, the NRA will continue to wield considerable influence, said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies gun policy. It has proved adept at mobilizing voters and cemented its influence by lobbying for judges, from state courts to the Supreme Court, who support its cause. The decline in its fortunes \"comes at a time when gun rights are particularly strong,\" Winkler said.\n\nMichael Bloomberg, founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, helped found and currently supports Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates safety measures.\n\nLawyers for the defendants argued that the attorney general, a Democrat, had sued their clients to fulfill a promise she made on the campaign trail, where she characterized the NRA as \"an organ of deadly propaganda.\"\n\nBut James has broad powers to investigate nonprofit groups registered in New York, where the AG's office has been more vigilant than many in holding nonprofits to account, said Linda Sugin, a Fordham University law professor who studies charities. Sugin said James's case centered on the proposition that NRA executives breached their fiduciary duties in a way that defied the group's very mission.\n\n(Beth Wang contributed to this report.)",

        "body": "Linkin Park has dropped a previously unreleased song that includes the voice of Chester Bennington on their upcoming album, Papercuts.\n\nThe new track, titled \"Friendly Fire,\" was first released on Friday and comes before the group's upcoming career-spanning greatest hits album, which drops April 12.\n\n\"Friendly Fire\" is a previously unreleased track from the band's 2017 album, One More Light.\n\nThe band first recorded the song for their seventh album, and filmed a corresponding music video. The \"Friendly Fire\" music video was also released on Friday and features never-before-seen studio and live footage.\n\nDirected and edited by long-time collaborator Mark Fiore, the song encapsulates the seven-year-old album's style.\n\nLead guitarist Brad Delson shared that the track \"was always one of our favorite songs from the One More Light sessions.\"\n\n\"Something about it wasn't quite right so as close as it got to the finish line, we chose to set it aside for later,\" continued Delson, 46. \"When we started looking for an unreleased track to include on our greatest hits collection, I was blown away by the power of the song, the power of the storytelling, the power of the vocal, the sonic landscape and I actually thought that it was closer than maybe we had realized at the time.\"\n\nMike Shinoda, the band's co-founder, added how it was a \"joy\" to assemble the tracklist for Papercuts. \"Each song in this collection is both a singular moment on our timeline and an evolving story that is as much ours as it is yours,\" said the musician, 47. \"From our first release, 'One Step Closer' to the brand-new 'Friendly Fire,' this tracklist spans all our chapters so far.\"\n\nThe upcoming album has a total of 20 tracks, including: \"Crawling,\" \"Faint,\" \"Numb/Encore,\" \"Papercut,\" \"Breaking The Habit,\" \"In The End,\" \"Bleed It Out,\" \"Somewhere I Belong,\" \"Waiting For The End,\" \"Castle Of Glass,\" \"One More Light,\" \"Burn It Down,\" \"What I've Done,\" \"QWERTY,\" \"One Step Closer,\" \"New Divide,\" \"Leave Out All the Rest,\" \"Lost,\" \"Numb\" and \"Friendly Fire.\"\n\nThe band has mostly been on hiatus since October 2017's Linkin Park and Friends: Celebrate Life in Honor of Chester Bennington tribute concert. However, in February 2023, for the 20th anniversary of the band's 2003 album Meteora, the band unveiled a previously unreleased song, \"Lost,\" that included Bennington's vocals.\n\nFans can pre-order or pre-save the upcoming album before the April 12 release.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.",

        "body": "CHASIV YAR, Ukraine -- In front of a small country house in eastern Ukraine, two gray-haired Ukrainian soldiers are tinkering with a worn-out dune buggy, their hands and faces covered in grime. The rickety contraption is powered by an engine ripped out of a Soviet-built Lada and wouldn't look out of place on the set of a Mad Max movie. \"We built it ourselves,\" says \"Kherson,\" who introduces himself as the commander of the unit before inviting us in for a cup of instant coffee.\n\nThe frontline is located a couple of miles away and artillery and the roar of jet engines echoes regularly in the distance, yet Kherson seems oblivious to the danger: in spite of his age and the injuries he's already sustained, the father of three tells us he's been fighting at the front for months without leave. \"Someone has to be doing the fighting,\" he says with a wide grin that reveals half a dozen metal fillings. As part of the 17th tank brigade of the Ukrainian army, Kherson's unit is tasked with conducting medical evacuations near the devastated town of Chasiv Yar, in the Donetsk oblast.\n\nFollowing the fall of the neighboring city of Bakhmut last May, Chasiv Yar has come under increasing pressure from Russian forces set on conquering the entirety of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, and only a handful of the town's 12,000 inhabitants still remain, surviving in the basements of bombed-out residential buildings. \"On average, we go out once or twice a day, but it depends on how intense the fighting is,\" Kherson tells us. The morning of our visit, the homemade buggy used by the unit to evacuate casualties had broken down, impeding their operations and leaving the men frustrated.\n\nWarming his hands over the stove, Kherson acknowledges that his unit is currently understrength after suffering casualties, adding that most of the men under his command are aged 50 and older. \"We took a direct hit from a tank, it blew off the legs of a soldier and I took some shrapnel,\" he says, showing the scar tissue on his right hand where a small piece of smoldering metal had hit him a couple of months prior.\n\nDespite still having some shrapnel lodged in his cheekbone, Kherson was back at the frontline within days of being injured. When they're not in the field, the man says that he uses the unit's Starlink satellite dish to keep in touch with his three children and his wife over social media: \"I miss them, but I'd rather be the one doing the fighting instead of them.\"\n\nTensions over mobilization numbers between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and President Zelensky spilled over into the public realm this month when out-going army chief Valerii Zaluzhny wrote an essay published by CNN complaining that he had not been provided with sufficient men. \"We must acknowledge the significant advantage enjoyed by [Russia] in mobilizing human resources and how that compares with the inability of state institutions in Ukraine to improve the manpower levels of our armed forces without the use of unpopular measures,\" he wrote.\n\nAs the war hits its second anniversary Saturday and casualties continue to mount, Ukraine has had to mobilize increasingly older soldiers to man the trenches and fend off intensifying Russian assaults all along the country's sprawling frontline. A foreign instructor with extensive combat experience, who asked to remain anonymous, told The Daily Beast that the newer recruits were clearly of a different vintage. \"The soldiers that I'm training now are significantly older, many come from hard labor, they have back problems, knee problems, some are career alcoholics,\" he said. Storming a muddy or frozen trench isn't as easy for a 50 year-old man as it is for a younger soldier.\"\n\nLate last year, an officer of the 28th Mechanized Brigade we had met in a cafe in Kramatorsk, in the Donetsk region, confirmed to the Daily Beast that conscripts now accounted for \"up to 90%\" of some units' personnel: \"Many of the soldiers under contract are either dead or injured, so we have to mobilize to replenish our ranks,\" he said.\n\nWhile there are no official statistics available on the average age of soldiers currently serving in the Ukrainian army, government officials have ventured out estimates: in an interview with \"The New Voice of Ukraine,\" Serhii Rakhmanin, a member of the Ukrainian parliamentary committee on national security, defense and intelligence claimed that the average age of a Ukrainian soldier was now between 40 and 45 years old. \"This applies not only to territorial defense brigades, but also, for example, to linear mechanized brigades and even units that should have been better prepared,\" he added. \"Such as, for example, mountain assault or amphibious assault [brigades].\" A few weeks prior, adviser to the head of the President's Office Serhii Leshchenko had made the startling claim on Ukrainian television that the average age in some companies was \"around 54 years.\"\n\nYet, some of the men withstanding the Russian onslaught in the country's East are older still: a couple of days prior to our meeting with Kherson, we had driven to Chasiv Yar itself to speak with drone operators from the 17th brigade. There, we parked our car next to an abandoned fire station before heading towards the center of the town, making our way down deserted avenues lined with burnt-out Soviet-style residential buildings, broken glass crunching under our shoes. As we turned the corner of a red brick building riddled with shrapnel holes, we came across a handful of Ukrainian soldiers from the 93rd brigade digging a trench by the side of the road. One of them excitedly introduced himself as \"Batya\" (which translates as \"Father\"), and told us he was celebrating that day his sixty-second birthday under Russian shelling. \"Though I'm pretty spry for my age,\" he adds proudly, before whipping out his phone to show us a video. Recorded by a Ukrainian drone hovering above the frontline, the footage shows Batya running out of a trench towards a Russian armored vehicle, before dropping a grenade through its open hatch. Moments later, the grenade detonates and plumes of white smoke come billowing out of the vehicle. \"Not bad for an old man,\" he says with a smile.\n\n\"Even though some of the soldiers are much older, they still have the desire to keep on fighting,\" confirms the foreign instructor over the phone. \"I have heard a great number of times those older soldiers saying that they're fighting precisely so that the younger generations don't have to.\"\n\nYet as the Russian invasion of its neighbor approaches its second anniversary, this younger generation could be increasingly called upon to shoulder the country's war effort: On January 30th, the Ukrainian government submitted a revised draft of its contentious mobilization law, which, among other provisions, would lower the age of conscription from 27 to 25.",

MITI also would like to recognise the contributions from various parties at all levels, including the various ministries, agencies and private sector that have assisted in expediting the investment commitments' implementation process,\" he said in a statement on Friday (Feb 23).\n\nTengku Zafrul said the total approved investment of RM329.5bil recorded for 2023 reflects the recovery and revival of the national economy.\n\n\"The 35.1% jump in domestic investments also reflects the confidence in the Madani government's policies,\" he said.\n\nHe cited several projects that succeeded to be implemented in a short duration -- less than 18 months -- including silicon battery company Enovix Corporation's unit Enovix Malaysia Sdn Bhd which was able to implement its project in less than six months.\n\nOther companies mentioned were Ferrotec Manufaturing Malaysia Sdn Bhd, which established Ferrotec Holdings' first manufacturing facility for electromechanical assembly and advanced material fabrication for semiconductor equipment in Southeast Asia, and Ultra Clean Technology (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, which invested in a capacity expansion project in Penang.\n\n\"The rapid and thorough implementation to realise the approved investments has been executed via platforms such as the National Investment Council (MPN), Investment and Trade Coordination Action Committee (JTPPP) and Investment Coordination Committee Meeting (ICCM).\n\n\"MIDA, through the Project Implementation and Facilitation Office (Track), is also committed in ensuring the approved manufacturing projects can be implemented immediately,\" he added. - Bernama",

Wendover Avenue and Penny Road that's been occupied by Tex & Shirley's Pancake House since 2005.\n\nThe seller was Tex & Shirley's owner Bart Ortiz, and the purchase price was $2 million.\n\n\"We are excited and we're going to try to do the best we can for the community,\" Llanaj said. \"It's three meals a day, seven days a week. We're open early in the morning until 9 each night. It's everything from breakfast to pasta, seafood, pizza -- you name it.\"\n\nHe said he doesn't plan to make any major changes to the 6,970-square-foot space, which will stay in operation during the transition to Cagney's Kitchen.\n\nLlanaj said the restaurant was founded about 25 years ago in Winston-Salem and has grown to 11 locations. This will be its first in High Point.\n\n\"We expanded in Greensboro about six months ago, and we see more and more opportunity in this area,\" he said. \"We might go to Raleigh next.\"\n\nThe sale was prompted by the retirement of Ortiz after 45 years with Tex & Shirley's. That brand's Greensboro restaurant is separately owned and will remain in operation.",

        "body": "NEW DELHI: The San Francisco 49ers made a significant roster move on Friday, announcing the release of veteran cornerback Isaiah Oliver. This decision comes after Oliver spent just one season with the team, having signed a two-year, $6.75 million deal in March of the previous year. The move, according to Spotrac, allows the 49ers to free up $2.4 million in salary cap space, a crucial factor given their financial constraints.\n\nDuring his tenure with the 49ers, Oliver appeared in 17 regular-season games, starting in six of them. He contributed 67 tackles, one interception, and one fumble recovery. However, despite his regular-season involvement, Oliver did not see any playing time on defense in the team's three postseason games. Instead, he was limited to special teams duties, accumulating 35 snaps in that capacity.\n\nPrior to joining the 49ers, Oliver had a notable career with the Atlanta Falcons, who selected him in the second round of the 2018 NFL Draft. Spending five seasons with the Falcons, Oliver started in 38 out of 62 games played for the franchise. Following the conclusion of the 2022 season, he opted to explore free agency, leading to his acquisition by the 49ers.\n\nAcross his NFL career, Oliver has amassed 270 tackles, three interceptions, three forced fumbles, and two sacks in a total of 79 games, with 44 starts. While his time with the 49ers may have been brief, Oliver's experience and contributions on the field have undoubtedly left an impact, both with his former team and the league at large.\n\n(Inputs from Reuters)",
