        "body": "Telcommnications operators (Telcos) under the aegis of the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), have threatened to drag Nigerian banks to court over the unpaid Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), which has accumulated over the years and has reached N130 billion as at September this year.\n\nChairman of ALTON, Gbenga Adebayo, who disclosed this during an interview at the weekend, said the telecoms operators decided to take the option of legal battle as the last resort, after several failed attempts to resolve the issue.\n\nAdebayo said the issue of unpaid USSD debt was part of its submission to the Minister of Communications, Innovation and Digital Economy, Dr. Bosun Tijani, when ALTON visited the Minister in Abuja last week.\n\nAccording to him, the Minister was displeased with the issue of unpaid USSD debt that has lingered for too long without concrete resolution, and advised Telcos to have an Independent Think-Tank that would look at the issues surrounding telecoms operations in Nigeria and develop empirical data that would best explain the economic implications of the challenges.\n\n\"The issue of USSD debt was discussed with the Minister, and he was quite concerned and worried that the matter has lingered for too long unresolved.\n\nSince the matter has dragged for too long, the best bet is to withdraw the USSD service from the banks and challenge them to pay for the accumulated debt that has reached N130 billion as at September this year. To get this done, we are contemplating at going to court to resolve the matter,\" Adebayo said.\n\nHe further said: \"The issue has lingered for too long and debt accumulated, and I think it's time to go to court to address the issue. We are thinking so because every effort made by Telcos and the government to make the banks pay their debt, has not yielded positive result. It has been like taking two steps forward and taking one step backward.\"\n\nAdebayo explained that the Telcos had a commercial service agreement with the banks, several years ago, to provide them with the USSD service that would enable seamless financial transactions like money transfers through the mobile phones, but regretted that the agreement went sour because the banks refused to keep to the agreement, which he said, had provisions for third party intervention, that includes legal action.\n\n\"The agreement permits parties to go to anywhere, including law court to resolve issues. So instead of the continuous meetings that have not yielded results, we are contemplating taking the next line of action, which is to go to court,\" Adebayo said.\n\nAdebayo had last month, said discussions were on-going and that there was increased commitment on the part of the banks to address the issue, unlike what was happening in the past when there was no commitment on the part of the banks to address the issue, which he said, led to the rise of the USSD debt to N130 billion as at September 2023.",

Activate your Digital Account now.\n\nSylas Alaimalo rushed for 213 yards and six touchdowns as Damien kept its ILH Division II hopes alive with a 69-35 rout of 'Iolani on Saturday night at Skippa Diaz Stadium.\n\nAlaimalo also had a 12-yard TD catch to finish the game with seven scores.\n\n\"That kid is special,\" Damien coach Anthony \"Bonez\" Tuitele said. \"I learned my lesson from the last game. I should've gave him the rock more. I love that kid, man. He comes from a great family. He was looking forward to this game. He put the team on his back.\"\n\nIn their previous matchup at Eddie Hamada Field, 'Iolani rallied from a 21-0 deficit for a 63-56 win.\n\n\"Well, we'll see if we make through tonight,\" 'Iolani coach Wendell Look said. \"We'll see how we lick our wounds and regroup, you know? We haven't had our okoles whupped like that in a while, so maybe it's a good thing. They did a hell of a job. Damien did a heck of a job. We had no answers tonight. No answers.\"\n\nAlaimalo, who carried 30 times, was elusive and powerful on everything from straight dives to toss sweeps.\n\n\"I give all my credit to my O-line. They let me do my thing,\" he said. \" 'Iolani brings it every time.\"\n\nAlaimalo also credited his coaches, who \"prepared me for everything coming my way.\"\n\nThe win improves Damien to 4-1 in ILH D-I play, now in a tie with 'Iolani. The two teams could meet for the title in a tiebreaker game soon.\n\nThe first half was a festival of offensive explosions. Damien led 41-21 at intermission behind 140 rushing yards and three touchdowns from Alaimalo. Damien amassed 249 yards of total offense.\n\nWhen 'Iolani cut the lead to 27-14 in the second quarter, the Monarchs kept their poise.\n\n\"I was able to talk to my coaches, just tell them keep the boys calm and doing their job,\" Tuitele said. \"The boys did it. They stayed focused. They didn't get too high. They didn't get too low. The goal was to continue to fight, stick together and finish strong.\"\n\n'Iolani fell behind 19-0 and went to the air almost exclusively. CJ Villanueva passed for 333 yards and five TDs in defeat.\n\nThe Monarchs scored on their opening drive, covering 65 yards in nine plays. Nalu Chinen-Zablan made a leaping grab on AJ Tuifua's throw for a 14-yard TD.\n\nMoments later, Wyatt Ho-Williams forced a fumble by 'Iolani wide receiver Keon Preusser. AJ Kanae Jr. returned the ball 39 yards down the left sideline to the 'Iolani 4-yard line.\n\nThe game was halted at that point due to an injury to a field official. His replacement took the field a few minutes later.\n\nOn the next snap, Alaimalo cut back to the left for a 4-yard TD run, and it was 13-0 with 7:30 to go in the opening quarter.\n\n'Iolani drove into Damien territory when Kanae was involved in another takeaway. His hit on Preusser after a completion led to another fumble, recovered by Micah Neizmen at the Raiders' 5-yard line.\n\nThe Monarchs marched 95 yards to pay dirt, scoring on Alaimalo's 55-yard run around left tackle for a 19-0 lead.\n\n'Iolani turned the ball over on downs and Damien needed just four plays to score. Alaimalo scored on an 8-yard toss sweep for a 27-0 Monarchs lead with 10:42 left in the first half.",

        "body": "The West should have realised from the start that challenging Russian national sovereignty and security was playing with fire\n\nIn 1997 American diplomat George Kennan stated that \"expanding Nato would be the most fateful error [of] American policy in the entire post-Cold War era\". And in 1999 Gregor Gaidar, a leading liberal in the Yeltsin government, argued that the Nato bombing in Yugoslavia was inflaming anti-American sentiment in Russia, \"pushing Russia towards isolationism, xenophobia and a new Cold War'.'\n\nPutin has proved that these early warnings were not mere posturing. In the face of the threat his anger was fully justified by Russian patriots and right-wing dictators, but roundly condemned by the UN. But historians maintained that much of what had happened was indeed predictable: the West should have realised from the start that challenging Russian national sovereignty and security was playing with fire.\n\nAs pointed out by Keith Naughton in The American Spectator: \"Ignoring Russian history is costly ... a large nation does not engage in the same pattern of behaviour for centuries for no reason.\" Of course, what historians and diplomats alike failed to consider was not so much the West's misreading of history, but the consequences of its feeble response to perennial, provocative Russian military expansion, most recently in Georgia (2008) and Ukraine (2014).\n\nThroughout the Cold War era the US wrestled between two policies: containment and military supremacy. Washington's foremost Kremlinologist and super diplomat, George Kennan, proposed a policy of containment, putting his faith in Soviet restraint and believing it would not start a war of influence in Europe.\n\nIn response, the Cold War introduced a policy of cautious and pragmatic containment that would give Russians time to get over \"being Soviets\", rather than consigning Russia and the West to endless stalemate. To avoid catastrophe, Kennan proclaimed, the two superpowers must agree on arms control measures rather than getting stuck in endless military one upmanship.\n\nProvocative assertiveness\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the end of the Cold War brought hope that the policy of containment (pax Americana) had finally been vindicated. But this was not to be. Containment was replaced by Western provocative assertiveness, resulting in Russian alienation and resentment.\n\nInevitably, the first noxious seeds of Putinism were planted as the Russians chose to become Soviets again. After a brief interlude between Yeltsin's \"democratic revolution\" and Putinism in the 1990s, the KGB siloviki (strongmen) took back Russia. In his presidential acceptance speech on May 7 2000 Putin gave notice that the Yeltsin democratic legacy would not last. It was not a new beginning.\n\n\"We should know our history as it was and take lessons from it, and always remember those who created the Russian state and defended its values, who made it a great and powerful state. We will preserve this memory and this connection through time ... and all the best from our country we will hand over to our descendants\", he said.\n\nAs intimated by Naughton, \"the run-up and trajectory of the war in Ukraine is very much a repeat of Russian history, yet Western governments have completely ignored this, and their obliviousness is proving costly''. Of course, this presupposes an untouchable Russia operating within certain given inalienable historical parameters rather submissively, \"red lines\" that should be respected.\n\nYet this seems utterly naive, defeatism \u00e0 la Neville Chamberlain at best, particularly in the context of Putinism.\n\nManipulated history\n\nThrough the ages Russia created its own myths, followed its own preferred history and interests irrespective of the rule of law or the dictates of human rights. Russian history is what Putin pronounces. Like other dictators, he has manipulated Russian history to enhance his own image, using the Kremlin's propaganda machine, state security apparatchiks, state-controlled media and sycophants in academia, the church and business to verify his self-serving notions.\n\nFor example, official Russian history \"\u00e0 la Putin\" legitimises the view that \"eternal\" Russia is undefeatable, while the liberal West is utterly decadent and a real danger to Russian perennial values and interests. At the 43rd Security Conference in Munich on February 10 2007 an aggrieved Putin declared that America's \"unilateral and frequently illegitimate\" actions have made the world a more chaotic place, created new centres of terror and caused new human tragedies.\n\nAfter that the totalitarian Orwellian state developed in full swing in Russia; no opposition was tolerated, with perfidious Putinism the uncontested creed of the land. The West, also termed in Stalinist terms \"enemies of the people\", or \"foreign agents\", were relentlessly used by the Kremlin to justify the repression of its own people.\n\nOn the other extreme, sycophantic praise singers such as Alexander Dugin, a professor at Moscow State University, swooned: \"There are no more opponents to the Putin course, and if there are they are ill and need psychiatric treatment. Putin is everywhere, Putin is everything, Putin is absolute, and Putin is irreplaceable\". Orthodox Patriarch Kiril chimed in, calling Putin \"a miracle, of God for Russia\".\n\nExcept during the brief Yeltsin democratic interlude in the 1990s, Russia never got over being homo sovieticus (conformist Soviet) again. Through his repressive politics, unrelenting falsities and propaganda, Putin has succeeded in closing the Russian mind. In 1996 polling by the Russian Levada Centre showed that 39% of Russians preferred the old Soviet model; only 28% opted for the democratic alternative.\n\nIn a more recent Lavada survey half of the respondents preferred the Soviet planned economy, while on the statement \"Russia is not a European country\" affirmations shot up from about 36% in 2008 to 64% in 2021. These are ominous indicators that the war in Ukraine is also about the future of a free world, which now faces its greatest test.",

And last month, our indigenous 'Narwhal' submarine was also launched at a ceremony,\" Tsai said.\n\n\"These achievements demonstrate our determination to safeguard national security,\" she added.\n\nTsai referred to the Advanced Trainer Jet (ATJ) program, also known as Brave Eagle launched in 2017.\n\nThe first prototype of the new ATJ, serial 11001/08-9001, flew for the first time in June 2020. The Industrial Development Corp., a domestic aerospace contractor, is scheduled to deliver 66 advanced trainer aircraft to Taiwan's Air Force by 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, Tsai also unveiled the \"Narwhal,\" the first boat developed under by the Indigenous Defense Submarine program, at a ceremony in Kaohsiung on Sept. 28.\n\nAt the time, Tsai described the event as a crucial moment in Taiwan's mission to produce domestic submarines and achieve \"defense autonomy.\"\n\nIn the Monday morning meeting, the president underlined that her government would continue to uphold the position of \"neither provoking nor acting rashly,\" as it will bolster cooperation with the United States and other like-minded democracies, and \"serve as a force for good.\"\n\nTsai made the comments when receiving the delegation, which included AEI President Robert Doar, leader of the think tank since 2019, and Dan Blumenthal, a senior AEI fellow researching East Asian security issues and Sino-American relations.\n\nFor his part, Doar praised Tsai for her leadership in helping Taiwan \"navigate what is an increasingly complicated geopolitical climate.\"\n\nHe also noted that the AEI has watched with horror as Hamas has \"unleashed war on Israel and the Jewish people,\" Doar said.\n\n\"The United States and AEI stand ready to come to the aid of a close friend under attack, and we appreciate Taiwan's support for Israel under your leadership,\" he added.",

His Democratic administration has pledged military support, sending U.S. carriers and aid to the region. Officials have said they would ask Congress for upward of $2 billion in additional aid for both Israel and Ukraine, which is fighting Russia's invasion.\n\nBlinken made the announcement early Tuesday after more than seven hours of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials.\n\nShortly after in Washington, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby announced that Biden would also go to Jordanto meet with King Abdullah, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nHumanitarian aid is stuck at Gaza-Egypt border as Israeli siege strains hospitals, water supply\n\nRAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Truckloads of aid idled at Egypt's border with Gaza as residents and humanitarian groups pleaded Monday for water, food and fuel for dying generators, saying the tiny Palestinian territory sealed off by Israel after last week's rampage by Hamas was near total collapse.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden will travel to Israel on Wednesday to signal White House support for the country and amid fears that Israel's war with Hamas could spread to other countries. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the trip early Tuesday in Tel Aviv following hours of talks with Israeli officials, and an invitation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIn Gaza, hospitals were on the verge of losing electricity, threatening the lives of thousands of patients, and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced from their homes searched for bread. Israel maintained punishing airstrikes across Gaza as a ground invasion loomed, while Hamas militants kept up a barrage of rocket attacks, and tensions mounted near the Israel-Lebanon border.\n\nMore than a week after Israel cut off entry of any supplies, all eyes were on the Rafah crossing, Gaza's only connection to Egypt. Mediators were trying to reach a cease-fire that would let in aid and let out trapped foreigners. Israeli airstrikes forced the crossing to shut down last week, but it remained unclear Monday which of the regional actors was keeping the crossing closed.\n\nBlinken said the U.S. and Israel had agreed to develop a plan to enable humanitarian aid to reach civilians in Gaza. There were few details, but the plan would include \"the possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm's way.\"\n\nMourners in heavily Palestinian Chicago suburb remember Muslim boy killed as kind, energetic\n\nBRIDGEVIEW, Ill. (AP) -- Crowds of mourners in a heavily Palestinian Chicago suburb paid respects Monday to a 6-year-old Muslim boy killed in an alleged hate crime, hours after authorities revealed new details about the evidence used to charge the family's landlord with stabbing the child and his mother.\n\nWadea Al-Fayoume, who had recently had a birthday, died Saturday after being stabbed dozens of times in a brutal attack that drew condemnation from local elected officials to the White House. Authorities said the family's landlord, Joseph Czuba, was upset over the Israel-Hamas war and attacked them after the boy's mother proposed they \"pray for peace.\"\n\nIn Bridgeview, which is home to a large and established Palestinian community, family and friends remembered Wadea as a kind and energetic boy who loved playing games. His body was carried in a small white casket -- which was at times draped with a Palestinian flag -- through packed crowds.\n\nMosque Foundation Imam Jamal Said reflected on the boy's death during the janazah, or funeral service, but also the wider loss of life in the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\"Wadea is a child and he is not the only one under attack,\" he said, adding many \"children are being slaughtered literally in the Holy Land, unfortunately, which is very sad.\"\n\nGunman kills two Swedes in Brussels, prompting terror alert and halt of Belgium-Sweden soccer match\n\nBRUSSELS (AP) -- Belgian police early Tuesday hunted for a gunman with suspected terrorist motives who killed two Swedes with stunning viciousness before disappearing into the night. He created such fear that authorities shut down a Belgium-Sweden soccer match and held 35,000 fans inside for several hours as a precaution.\n\nEric Van Duyse, spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office, said the investigation was centering on \"a possible terrorist motivation for the shooting\" after \"a claim of responsibility was posted on social media.\"\n\n\"This person claims to be inspired by Islamic State,\" Van Duyse said. \"The Swedish nationality of the victims was put forward as the probable motive.\" Sweden raised its terror alert to the second-highest level in August after a series of public Quran-burnings by an Iraqi refugee living in Sweden resulted in threats from Islamic militant groups.\n\n\"At this time, no element indicates a possible link with the Israeli-Palestinian situation,\" Van Duyse said, offering scant relief on a continent where many nations have increased their vigilance for fear of attacks linked to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIn Belgium, the anti-terror center said the terror alert in the capital was raised to its top rating of 4, meaning a \"threat is extremely serious.\" It previously stood at 2, which means the threat was average. The alert level or the rest of the country was raised to 2.\n\nGOP's Jim Jordan is shoring up support and peeling off detractors ahead of a House speaker vote\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- With a push by allies of Donald Trump, far-right firebrand Rep. Jim Jordan appeared Monday to be shoring up support to become U.S. House speaker, winning over reluctant Republicans who have few options left two weeks after Kevin McCarthy's ouster.\n\nOne by one, Jordan, the hard-charging Judiciary Committee chairman, has been peeling off detractors who view the Ohio Republican as too extreme. A major pressure campaign from Trump allies including Steve Bannon and Fox News' Sean Hannity has helped quickly build support. Tuesday's scheduled floor vote could turn into a showdown.\n\n\"I feel real good about the momentum we have,\" Jordan said outside his office in Washington.\n\nAhead of a private GOP meeting Monday evening, Jordan took a cooperative tone vowing to \"bring all Republicans together\" if he becomes House speaker after the ouster of McCarthy.\n\n\"The country and our conference cannot afford us attacking each other right now,\" Jordan wrote in a letter to colleagues. \"It is time we unite to get back to work on behalf of the American people.\"\n\nTrump has narrow gag order imposed on him by federal judge overseeing 2020 election subversion case\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal judge overseeing the 2020 election interference case against Donald Trump in Washington imposed a narrow gag order on him on Monday, barring the Republican former president from making statements targeting prosecutors, possible witnesses and court staff.\n\nThe order from U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan marks a milestone moment in the federal case that accuses Trump of illegally conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. It's the most serious restriction a court has placed on Trump's incendiary rhetoric, which has become a centerpiece of his grievance-filled campaign to return to the White House while fighting criminal charges in four cases.\n\nThe order may end a line of attack that Trump has made central to his campaign for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. But it may be only the beginning of an unprecedented fight over what limits can be a placed on the speech of a defendant who is also campaigning for America's highest public office.\n\nIn a social media post shortly after the hearing in Washington's federal court, Trump vowed to appeal. During a campaign appearance in Iowa later Monday, Trump decried the order as unconstitutional, and claimed it would only help him in the polls.\n\nSpeaking from the bench, Chutkan said Trump is entitled to criticize the Justice Department generally and assert his belief that the case is politically motivated but can't mount a \"smear campaign\" against prosecutors and court personnel.\n\nTim Scott praises 'restraint' of Israel's Netanyahu, says US should move more firepower to region\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina on Monday praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for showing what he called \"restraint\" after Hamas attacked Israel over a week ago.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate said Netanyahu \"waited\" and showed \"patience\" and \"humanity\" in response to the Oct. 7 attack.\n\nIsrael launched airstrikes in Gaza the day of the attack and Netanyahu declared war with Hamas, vowing to inflict an \"unprecedented price.\" The war has become the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides, with more than 4,000 dead.\n\n\"One of the first things that Israel's done is they waited,\" Scott said about Israel as he spoke at an event focused on U.S. foreign policy and national security at Georgetown University in Washington.\n\n\"Now how Prime Minister Netanyahu had the kind of restraint to refrain from immediate action, it just talks about the morality and the humanity that we see coming from Netanyahu into Gaza,\" the senator said.\n\nEcuador's youngest elected president faces a practically impossible task\n\nQUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador 's youngest elected president on Monday faced the practically impossible task of reducing a terrifying, drug-driven crime wave within a greatly shortened 1 1/2 years in office.\n\nDaniel Noboa, 35, is an heir to one of Ecuador's largest fortunes thanks to a global empire built on bananas -- the country's main crop.\n\nHis voters were, among other things, frightened by the escalation of drug violence over the past three years. Killings, kidnappings, robberies and other criminal activities have become part of everyday life, leaving Ecuadorians wondering when, not if, they will be victims.\n\nThe spike in violence is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. Mexican, Colombian and Balkan cartels have set down roots in Ecuador and operate with assistance from local criminal gangs.\n\nPresidential candidate and anti-corruption crusader Fernando Villavicencio was assassinated in August. Since then, other politicians and political leaders have been killed or kidnapped, car bombs have exploded in multiple cities, including the capital, Quito, and inmates have rioted in prisons. Earlier this month, seven men held as suspects in Villavicencio's slaying were killed inside prisons.\n\nRite Aid seeks Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as it deals with lawsuits and losses\n\nRite Aid has filed for bankruptcy protection and plans to sell part of its business as it attempts to restructure while dealing with losses and opioid-related lawsuits.\n\nThe company said Rite Aid stores will continue to fill prescriptions, and customers will still be able to visit its locations or shop online while it goes through its voluntary Chapter 11 process. But that process also will allow it to speed up its plan to close underperforming stores.\n\nGoing through Chapter 11 will help \"significantly reduce the company's debt\" while helping to \"resolve litigation claims in an equitable manner,\" Rite Aid late Sunday.\n\nRite Aid Corp. said in its federal bankruptcy filing that it runs more than 2,000 stores. Most of its locations are on the East and West Coasts.\n\nThe Philadelphia company, which is marking its 60th year in business, has posted annual losses for several years and has been cutting costs and closing stores as it dealt with long-standing financial challenges. It has said it expects a net loss of as much as $680 million in the current fiscal year, which will end next spring.\n\nRangers build big early lead off Valdez, hold on for 5-4 win over Astros to take 2-0 lead in ALCS\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Jonah Heim homered, Nathan Eovaldi pitched six effective innings and the Texas Rangers beat Framber Valdez and Houston Astros 5-4 on Monday for a 2-0 lead in the AL Championship Series.\n\nAdolis Garc\u00eda, Mitch Garver and Nathaniel Lowe each hit an RBI single during Texas' four-run first inning against Valdez, and Jos\u00e9 Leclerc closed it out for the Rangers after Yordan Alvarez powered an Astros rally.\n\nEovaldi struck out nine, including two in a row after Houston loaded the bases with none out in the fifth. He was charged with three runs and five hits in his third win this postseason.\n\nThe Rangers improved to 7-0 in the playoffs, including six wins on the road. They swept the Rays in the Wild Card Series and the Orioles in the Division Series, and then posted a 2-0 win at Houston in the ALCS opener.\n\nGame 3 of the best-of-seven series is Wednesday night in Arlington.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON (TND) -- Secretary of State Anthony Blinken announced in a news conference Monday evening that President Joe Biden will travel to war-torn Israel Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking from the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, following meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Blinken outlined a specific set of priorities the president hoped to address by putting his boots on the ground in the war-torn Jewish state.\n\n\"First, the president will reaffirm the United States' solidarity with Israel, and our ironclad commitment to its security,\" the U.S.'s top diplomat explained during the early working (3:00 a.m. local time) media appearance. \"President Biden will again make clear, as he's done unequivocally since Hamas' slaughter of more than 1400 people - including at least 30 Americans - that Israel has the right and indeed the duty to defend its people from Hamas and other terrorists and to prevent future attacks.\"\n\nBlinken continued saying Biden also intends to \"hear from the people of Israel\" to learn on a more first-person basis what Israelis say they need as a potential aid package lethargically works its way through a paralyzed Congress.\n\nThe president will further use the moment to continue his recent, frequent warnings to Israel's adversaries to cease any designs on taking advantage of the crisis to launch an attack.\n\n\"Don't,\" Blinken said, repeating the one-word phrase that Biden has sternly and seriously conjured in his cautions to potential bad actors. Along those lines, the Secretary of State affirmed that Biden would engage more directly with Israeli partner to work towards the safe release and return of the over 200 (Hamas counts put it as high as 250) hostages taken by Hamas terrorists in their swift invasion of the Jewish state on Oct. 7.\n\nThe appearance in Israel also marks an attempt for commander-in-chief to gain a better on-the-ground sense of Israel's military plans, especially concerning the ability to open up corridors in the Gaza Strip to allow Palestinians access to desparately needed, critical humanitarian aid.",

        "body": "(CNN) -- Michael Caine, the British film star whose career has spanned eight decades and featured movies from \"The Italian Job\" to \"The Dark Knight,\" has confirmed his retirement from acting.\n\nThe two-time Oscar winner, who is 90, made the announcement on BBC Radio 4's \"Best of Today\" podcast on Saturday.\n\n\"I keep saying I'm going to retire,\" said Caine, adding: \"Well, I am now.\"\n\nHe confirmed that \"The Great Escaper,\" which was released earlier this month, will be his last acting gig, saying: \"I've played the lead and it's got incredible reviews. The only parts I'm going to get now are old men - 90-year-old men, or maybe 85, you know - and I thought well I might as well leave with all this. I've got wonderful reviews. What am I going to do to beat this?\"\n\nCaine starred alongside the late Glenda Jackson in the movie, playing Bernard Jordan, a 90-year-old who absconds from a care home to attend the 70th Anniversary of the D-Day Landings in France.\n\n\"We had a great time on the movie and I thought, you know, why not leave now?\" Caine added.\n\nAlso speaking on the podcast, \"The Great Escaper\" director Oliver Parker said, \"Michael has this ability to turn his performance into something else,\" crediting his \"charisma\" and \"sheer presence.\"\n\nCaine began his acting career on the stage in the early 1950s, before making his movie debut in 1956.\n\nOriginally called Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, Jr., he adopted the screen name Caine - taken from the 1954 film \"The Caine Mutiny\" - and later made it legal.\n\nCaine has played secret agents, playboys, adventurers, schoolteachers and killers.\n\nHe portrayed the British spy Harry Palmer in five films, with fame coming after his first stint in the role, in the 1965 drama thriller \"The Ipcress File.\"\n\nHis next big break came a year later, when he starred as a promiscuous chauffeur in the 1966 romantic comedy \"Alfie.\"\n\nCaine received his first Academy Award for his supporting role in the 1986 Woody Allen film \"Hannah and Her Sisters,\" and the second for another supporting role, in the 1999 film \"The Cider House Rules.\"\n\nHe starred alongside Sean Connery in John Huston's 1975 adventure movie \"The Man Who Would Be King;\" played a journalist in Vietnam in the 2002 Graham Greene adaptation \"The Quiet American;\" and portrayed butler Alfred Pennyworth in the 2008 film \"The Dark Knight.\"\n\nCaine was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1993, and he was knighted in 2000.\n\nHe has also written books, saying on the podcast that he has made 160 movies and that he \"always wanted to be a writer.\" While there will be no more acting, he said, \"there will be writing.\"\n\n\"The thing about movie-making is you have to get up at 6.30 in the morning, do a long ride learning your lines in the bloody car and then get there and work until 10 o'clock at night,\" he said, adding that with writing \"you don't have to get out of bed.\"",

Carmel finished with a 27-0 record.\n\n\"Being the decider and clinching the point this year was huge to me,\" Li said. \"I was actually the person to lose the final point that knocked us out of the state tournament last year, so finally winning and bringing the trophy back home was an unforgettable moment.\"\n\nLi said it was sweeter than winning the state title as a freshman. The Greyhounds lost to West Lafayette Harrison 3-2 in the regional final last year. Carmel had previously captured six consecutive state titles.\n\n\"Being able to finally show my worth and effort on the court was a sensation I could never forget,\" said Li, who defeated Columbus North's Parth Shah 6-3, 6-1.\n\nCarmel defeated defending state champion and third-ranked North Central 4-1 in the state quarterfinals Oct. 13 at CHS.\n\nRain then forced the semifinals and final matches to move after a wait during rain at North Central High School.\n\n\"It's not easy to get high school kids to concentrate from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.,\" Greyhounds coach Dan Brunette said.\n\nRather than play all the singles at once and doubles afterwards because of the number of courts available, Carmel and Culver Academies chose to have their teams play all together and the winner would have less rest for the final. The two began play after Columbus North edged No. 8 Jasper 3-2 in the opening semifinal.\n\nCarmel topped No. 6 Culver 4-1, with the only loss coming at No. 1 singles.\n\n\"It was a tough setup,\" Brunette said. \"It's a lot on your mind to watch one match, knowing you have to play one match and if you win that, you have to play another one right away. I was impressed with their level of maturity and discipline. It was a long day physically and mentally.\"\n\nCHS sophomore Wesley Worobel topped Columbus North's Austin Clark 6-0, 6-2. The No. 2 doubles team of freshmen David Liu and Grant Mu won the third point, topping Michael Crossman and Yoki Murabayashi 6-2, 6-1.\n\nThe Bull Dogs' (24-2) strength all season was at No. 1 singles and No. 1 doubles.\n\nNorth's Hank Lin topped senior Jonathan Yang 6-0, 6-1 at No. 1 singles.\n\nCarmel junior Michael Bao and senior Braedon McIntyre suffered their first loss of the season, falling to Anvay Atram and Amrit Kar 6-3, 7-5.\n\n\"Lin and the two doubles players have a lot of experience,\" Brunette said. \"We knew they were going to be tough matches. I thought we would be favored in the other three and we took care of business. We didn't play our best match of the year at No. 1 doubles. (North's) team played well and they kept us out of our rhythm.\"\n\nThat eliminated Bao and McIntyre from the state doubles competition. Bao and McIntyre lost in the state doubles semifinals last year.\n\n\"It was disappointing,\" Brunette said. \"I feel for those guys. But by the same token, we don't talk about individual titles. We talk about the team, and that's what we work for.\"\n\nYang earned the Mental Attitude Award for boys tennis.\n\n\"He's a great leader for the team and a great student-athlete at Carmel,\" Brunette said. \"He's a special kid.\"\n\nMore Headlines Crowning achievement: Health challenges don't stop Carmel woman from chasing, reaching her dreams Carmel in brief -- October 17, 2023 Hamilton Southeastern Schools hires new director of staff and student services Schaibley to retire from state legislature at end of term Carmel resident turns heads and chairs on 'The Voice' Humane society to offer free microchip event Oct. 14 in Carmel",

        "body": "Chris Billam-Smith appears to be set for a voluntary title defense before he is ordered to face his mandatory contender.\n\nBoxingScene.com has confirmed that the reigning WBO cruiserweight titlist is due to put his belt on the line in early December. The frontrunner to land the assignment is Poland's Mateusz Masternak, who has reportedly signed to challenge for the title according to Ring Polska.\n\nBillam-Smith (18-1, 12KOs) won the title in a twelve-round decision over 201-6 Olympian and previously unbeaten titlist Lawrence Okolie on May 27 in his hometown of Bournemouth, England. There were talks of a rematch between the former training stablemates, though Masternak has since emerged as the likely candidate to face the 33-year-old Brit.\n\nIt was acknowledged during the WBO convention that Billam-Smith was permitted to advance with the voluntary title fight. His mandatory will be due after that, with countryman Richard Riakporhe presently the top ranked cruiserweight.\n\nBoth boxers presently fight under the BOXXER banner. Riakporhe beat Billiam-Smith via ten-round, split decision in a July 2019 matchup of unbeaten prospects at The O2 in L\n\nMasternak (47-5, 31KOs) has won six in a row since an October 2018 points loss to Yuniel Dorticos in their World Boxing Super Series cruiserweight tournament quarterfinal matchup in Orlando, Florida. The 36-year-old Pole has not fought since a twelve-round, unanimous decision over previously unbeaten Jason Whateley last October 29 in Zakopane, Poland.\n\nThe year-plus long layoff ahead of his potential first career title fight is in part due to his being pulled from a mandatory title challenge versus lineal/IBF cruiserweight champion Jai Opetaia. The matter was due to head to a purse bid before his team pulled him from the bout, with the belief at the time that he was next in line to face Billam-Smith in October.\n\nIt was acknowledged during the WBO convention that Billam-Smith was permitted to advance with the voluntary title fight. His mandatory will be due after that, with countryman Richard Riakporhe presently the top ranked cruiserweight.\n\nBoth boxers presently fight under the BOXXER banner. Riakporhe beat Billiam-Smith via ten-round, split decision in a July 2019 matchup of unbeaten prospects at The O2 in London. Billam-Smith has won nine straight since that night.",

US intelligence agencies have concluded that North Korea has requested fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armoured vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment and other materials and advanced technologies.",

        "body": "In a heinous crime that took place in Plainfield village in Illinois, a six-year-old Palestinian-American child was stabbed to death by a 71-year-old man on Saturday.\n\nAccording to media reports, the boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, and his 32-year-old mother, Hanaan Shahin, were attacked by their landlord, Joseph Czuba. Wadea tragically lost his life, while Shahin was hospitalised.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the landlord, who was angered by developments he had seen in the news, knocked on the door of his tenants. As soon as Shahin opened the door, he attempted to attack her with a knife while yelling, \"You Muslims must die.\"\n\nAlthough she managed to escape into the bathroom and call 911, her son lost his life due to multiple stab wounds. The landlord reportedly stabbed the boy 26 times.\n\nShahin has been living in the US for the past 12 years, and Wadea was born in the United States. The boy's funeral will take place on Monday.\n\nFollowing this heinous crime, Czuba has been charged with first-degree murder and other crimes. He has been taken into Will County's Adult Detention facility.\n\nThe Will County Sheriff's Office has described the crime as 'senseless' and 'cowardly.'\n\nMeanwhile, US President Joe Biden issued the following statement regarding this heinous crime.\n\n\"Jill and I were shocked and sickened to learn of the brutal murder of a six-year-old child and the attempted murder of the child's mother in their home yesterday in Illinois.\n\nThe child's Palestinian Muslim family came to America seeking what we all seek -- a refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace.\n\nThis horrific act of hate has no place in America, and stands against our fundamental values: freedom from fear for how we pray, what we believe, and who we are.\n\nAs Americans, we must come together and reject Islamophobia and all forms of bigotry and hatred. I have said repeatedly that I will not be silent in the face of hate. We must be unequivocal. There is no place in America for hate against anyone.\n\nWe join everyone here at the White House in sending our condolences and prayers to the family, including for the mother's recovery, and to the broader Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim American communities.\"\n\nGovernor JB Pritzker also released a statement that reads, \"To take a six-year-old child's life in the name of bigotry is nothing short of evil... Every single Illinoisan - including our Muslim, Jewish, and Palestinian neighbors - deserves to live free from the threat of such evil.\"\n\nMany others, including US Senator Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin, have condemned the incident.",

Italy's Council of Ministers on Monday adopted the country's 24-billion-euro (25.3 billion U.S. dollars) budget for 2024, which includes funding for a new bridge connecting the mainland to Sicily. (Photo by Alberto Lingria/Xinhua)\n\nROME, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Council of Ministers on Monday adopted the country's 24-billion-euro (25.3 billion U.S. dollars) budget for 2024, which includes funding for a new bridge connecting the mainland to Sicily.\n\nThe budget bill also streamlines the Italy's tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets, provides free daycare for families with more than one child, and raises the workers' salary in the state health care system.\n\nThe next step is for the bill to be submitted to the European Union watchdogs for approval and for it to clear both houses of Italy's Parliament. By law, all these must happen by the end of the year.\n\nFunding for the Messina Bridge project had been in doubt up until the final negotiations and the initiative is yet to win a thumbs-up from European regulators or from Parliament. But its inclusion in the budget is a significant step forward for the project.\n\nIf ultimately constructed, the bridge connecting the Sicilian city of Messina with Reggio Calabria near the toe of Italy's boot-shaped peninsula would be the longest suspension bridge in the world, measuring 3,666 meters.\n\nThe case in favor of the bridge includes promoting economic development of both sides of the bridge by reducing transport costs and times. But critics of the project worry about cost overruns, vulnerability to earthquakes and adverse environmental impacts. The project is reportedly to cost around 12 billion euros spread over 15 years.\n\nThe budget also reduces the number of income tax brackets to three from the current four, combining the lowest two income categories into one and increasing the cap for tax-free income by nearly 4 percent.\n\nIn addition to providing free childcare for families with at least two children, the budget would also allow mothers of at least two children to stop paying social security contributions on their income starting next year. The measures are part of a wider plan to help slow the decline in Italy's population.\n\n\"We want to dismantle the narrative that says having children is a disincentive to work,\" Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told a press conference following the bill's approval.\n\nThe budget earmarks over 2 billion euros for salary increases for state health care workers. If passed, it would be a major blanket salary hike for the sector since 2020. (1 euro = 1.05 U.S. dollars)",

Senior State Counsel (SSC) Dr Avanthi Perera though, informed court that the AG's Department would not be submitting these reports to court as the AG will not be representing these universities. She said the AG's Department will inform the universities to hire outside counsel and submit the reports through them.\n\nDr Perera said the AG will only be representing the Inspector General of Police, the University Grants Commission and the Minister of Higher Education during the hearing into the petition.\n\nSeveral counsel who represented some of the universities then asked court to allow their clients more time to submit their reports.\n\nThe petition had been filed by Harshana De Silva, who was a first year student at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. He had alleged in his petition that his fundamental rights had been violated during a ragging incident in 2020 where senior students had thrown a tyre onto him, resulting in him suffering serious injuries from which he is yet to recover.\n\nShavindra Fernando, PC, who appeared for the petitioner, told the three-judge bench comprising Justices Buwaneka Aluwihare, Shiran Gooneratne and Priyantha Fernando that his client is not seeking any monetary compensation. He said the petitioner is asking that a set of guidelines be introduced to prevent such unfortunate incidents from occurring at universities in future.\n\nTaking matters into consideration, the court ordered the universities to submit their reports by November 10.",

        "body": "Editor's note: The year of 2023 marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative. Ten experts share their views with China Daily on how the initiative promotes economic development and improves people's livelihoods.\n\nInitiative has become a game changer globally\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative has become a game changer on many levels globally. It has provided a model for transboundary economic cooperation. Its emphasis on the common goals of development of nations, transcending political, cultural and ideological differences, is a unique feature of the initiative. And the fact that it respects the sovereignty and dignity of the countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative is an important addition to international relations and global governance.\n\nMore important, the Belt and Road Initiative has put the \"win-win\" concept on the world cognitive map at a time when zero-sum games and the-winner-takes-it-all have become the norm for some major Western economies.\n\nChina has presented a world view which believes that \"your prosperity is my prosperity\", and if your neighbor's house is burning, you cannot be sure of the safety of your own house.\n\nIn terms of development financing and goals, the initiative presents an effective and coordinated way of achieving them based on long-term results rather than immediate monetary gains. Also, China believes in helping other countries realize development by building and improving large-scale infrastructure instead of providing them with \"aid\" which runs off into the sand, perpetuating poverty.\n\nIn terms of economic-scientific thinking, the emphasis on clearing the \"three bottlenecks of development\" in Africa -- by filling the financing gap, helping build or improve the needed infrastructure, and addressing the shortage of skilled labour -- is key to eradicating poverty and ushering in development.\n\nHussein Askary is vice-chairman of the Belt and Road Institute in Sweden.\n\nBRI vital to international cooperation, development\n\nThe year of 2023 marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative, which is aimed at improving infrastructure connectivity and serves as a catalyst for economic development and shared prosperity for all by championing multilateralism and global unity.\n\nThe initiative stands as a transformative platform in the realm of international cooperation, representing a decade of concerted efforts to achieve win-win cooperation across various domains. The ambitious project, which facilitates policy exchanges and road connectivity, promotes trade and creates jobs.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping's unwavering commitment to global development and peace deserves commendation, especially because China has been playing a pivotal role in assisting countries in their pursuit of a shared future through Belt and Road projects.\n\nOne exemplary manifestation of the Belt and Road Initiative's impact is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Over the past decade, the CPEC has transformed from a concept to a tangible reality, reshaping Pakistan's development landscape. It has not only deepened economic cooperation but also bolstered cultural ties between China and Pakistan. With its focus on development and its inclusive nature, it has helped improve the energy and transportation sectors of Pakistan and other Belt and Road countries.\n\nIndeed, the CPEC signifies a momentous vision, cementing an unbreakable bond between China and Pakistan in their collective pursuit of a human community with a shared future.\n\nChina's sincere pursuit of global development goals are exemplary and offer valuable lessons to the world. The international community should look to China as a model of effective collaboration and sustainable development.\n\nKhalid Taimur Akram is executive director of the Pakistan Research Center for a Community with Shared Future in Islamabad.\n\nConnectivity, synergy and opportunities\n\nAs connectivity has become a defining feature of a modern economy, it is evident that connectivity needs impetus, planning and proper implementation. The Belt and Road Initiative helps make those connectivity goals a reality.\n\nEvidence abound on the successful endeavors of countries that were wise enough to see the potential beforehand and pragmatic enough to lay the grounds for a cooperation that would benefit all sides involved.\n\nCentral and Eastern Europe have seen several such tangible results, including in the Budapest-Belgrade high-speed railway, the Pelje ac Bridge in Croatia, the Port of Piraeus in Greece, and hundreds of kilometers of highways throughout the Balkans built with Chinese funding and expertise.\n\nIn addition to the short-term impact of infrastructure investment, there are also medium- and long-term effects in strengthening the basis for future economic growth, including making labor more efficient and productive, which for Southern and Eastern Europe means narrowing the gap with wealthier Western Europe.\n\nThe world has become a different place since the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative, but the initiative has to evolve to enable countries to capitalize on its strengths and identify its untapped potential. With China's rapid growth and chaotic conditions worldwide, it is of vital importance that the world must understand China's role. The initiative offers a proper lens to see China's approach to global development and its efforts to build a human community with a shared future for mankind.\n\nMarsela Musabelliu is the executive director of the Albanian Institute for Globalization Studies.\n\nBRI filling infrastructure and funds gaps\n\nIn the 10 years since it was proposed, the Belt and Road Initiative has become an important global public good, generating tangible benefits for countries including increased investment, job creation and improved livelihoods. The initiative has progressed from a vision to reality, yielding tangible results for Belt and Road countries and their peoples.\n\nInfrastructure development is essential for economic development, and there is a huge need of funds in developing countries to narrow the investment gap. But the lack of proper infrastructure has held up the development of many countries. Better connectivity and deeper economic cooperation are needed to facilitate the development of many countries.\n\nFortunately, the initiative has been filling the funds and infrastructure gaps in many countries, thus boosting regional and global trade. That's why more than 150 countries and 30 international organizations have already signed the Belt and Road cooperation documents with China.\n\nSri Lanka, too, has launched a series of development projects under the Belt and Road framework, leading to a huge improvement in its infrastructure. The Belt and Road Initiative is also promoting Sri Lanka's economic growth, creating jobs and improving people's livelihoods.\n\nChina is a great friend of Sri Lanka and has always supported the country in safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity. China has also provided much-needed emergency humanitarian aid for Sri Lanka in times of crisis.\n\nBesides, China has agreed to strengthen cooperation with local and foreign companies, and contribute more to Sri Lanka's economic recovery. But some countries have been countering China and the Belt and Road Initiative while proposing many alternative initiatives some of which fail to even take off.\n\nWhether some countries like it or not, the Belt and Road Initiative has been driving infrastructure development globally, and improving connectivity and trade.\n\nMaya Majueran is director of the Belt and Road Initiative Sri Lanka, an independent and pioneering Sri Lanka-based think tank.\n\nInitiative changes the world for the better\n\nIt's impossible to overstate just how much the Belt and Road Initiative has changed the world in the decade since it was proposed. In many countries, too many so-called leaders say nice words that people want to hear, but few deliver on the (false) promises they make to lure the people, mostly for votes. Sadly, when the world is facing horrendous problems, such as climate change, global public health, poverty and war, some countries have chosen confrontation over cooperation, ostensibly to perpetuate their hegemony.\n\nPresident Xi put forward the idea of building a \"human community with a shared future\" in a speech at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations on March 23, 2013. To turn words into action, later the same year, during his visits to Kazakhstan and Indonesia, President Xi proposed a very significant global initiative, the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nOscar Wilde once said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Former US president Donald Trump proposed the now-forgotten \"Blue Dot Network\", which unsuccessfully tried to counter the Belt and Road Initiative in sectors such as the digital economy, cybersecurity, energy and infrastructure development. Incumbent US President Joe Biden and the G7 have proposed the \"Build Back Better World\" initiative which one never hears about nowadays, proving that it was only a pathetic attempt to counter China's initiative by trying to ape it. Similarly, the European Union has its \"Global Gateway Project\" which seems to be a highway to nowhere.\n\nOn Jan 17 of that year, on a state visit to Switzerland, President Xi repeated his call for building a community with a shared future for mankind at the United Nations office in Geneva. Three days later, after his inauguration as US president, Trump said: \"From this day forward, it's going to be 'America first'. \" Sadly, it still is. With so many existential threats facing humankind, why can't we work together?\n\nHarvey Dzodin is a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization.\n\nDiversified energy market beneficial for all\n\nQatar is the world's top liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter. However, the competition for LNG has intensified since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, because countries, especially major powers, need huge volumes of LNG from other sources to make up for the shortage created in reduced Russian LNG supply. China is one of the powers that is keen to diversify its sources of energy.\n\nFor this reason, China is keen to strengthen relations with countries in the Middle East, Qatar in particular. In fact, on June 20 this year, Qatar and China signed a 27-year agreement under which Qatar will supply China with 4 million tons of LNG annually. This follows a similar 27-year agreement that Qatar Energy and China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation signed in November 2022. With this deal, Qatar replaced Australia as China's largest LNG supplier.\n\nQatar is aware that China, as a reliable long-term importer of energy, is growing as a consistent consumer of Gulf countries' energy. This is mirrored in the trade relations between Qatar and China -- China has been Qatar's top trading partner since 2021. China-Qatar trade last year reached about $25 billion, of which Qatari exports to China were worth $20 billion. I believe China, with its huge market, will become the preferred destination for many Middle East countries' energy exports.\n\nKheir Diabat is a professor in the Foreign Affairs Department of Qatar University.\n\nBRI, RCEP to help Cambodia realize its development goals\n\nOver the past decade, more than 150 countries and 30 international organizations have joined the Belt and Road Initiative, which has achieved remarkable success since its launch in 2013.\n\nThe initiative provides a non-discriminatory and inclusive platform for cooperation, and has helped further increase ASEAN-China trade. China is now the largest trade partner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, with the China-ASEAN trade volume reaching 2.59 trillion yuan ($356.15 billion) in the first five months of 2023.\n\nCambodia is one of the staunchest supporters of the Belt and Road Initiative, because it has reaped tremendous benefits from Belt and Road infrastructure projects, including the construction of the Siem Reap International Airport and the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway, the country's first expressway, which was completed in October last year.\n\nBy the end of 2017, more than 2,000 kilometers of roads, seven long bridges and a new container terminal at Phnom Penh Autonomous Port had been built with support from China. At present, Cambodia's second expressway, the 135-km-long expressway to Bavet City, is being built by China Bridge and Road Corp. for a cost of $1.35 billion.\n\nThe initiative provides an excellent opportunity for Cambodia and China to raise their relations to a new level, not least because the two countries' economies complement each other, and their political relations are strong and stable.\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative, along with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement, will help Cambodia achieve its development goals.\n\nKin Phea is director-general of the International Relations Institute of Cambodia, Royal Academy of Cambodia.\n\nInitiative strengthens China-Chile ties\n\nThere are many \"firsts\" in China-Chile relations. Chile was the first South American country to establish diplomatic relations and the first to sign a free trade agreement with China, as well as the first to recognize China as a market economy. It was also in Chile, in January 2018, that all the member states of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, CELAC, issued with China a joint statement underlining the importance of the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nOf the five pillars of the memorandum of understanding signed by Chile and China on the Belt and Road Initiative, Chile has already reaped rich dividends from bilateral trade. With China being the largest trading partner of Chile, the two sides have made important advances in investment, and in July 2021, the Chilean Financial Market Commission approved the opening of a representative office of the Export-Import Bank of China.\n\nTwo years earlier, China Construction Bank and Bank of China opened their offices in Chile. Tianqi Lithium has the highest stakes among all Chinese companies in Chile's mining sector. In 2018, Tianqi acquired 24 percent of SQM for $4.1 billion, a key entity in lithium production, and Chile put into service the largest fleet of electric buses, including double-decker buses, a major change in the country's urban transportation system, outside of China.\n\nAnd while former Chilean president Michelle Bachelet attended the first Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing in 2017, previous Chilean president Sebastian Pi era, participated in the second Belt and Road forum in 2019 -- a practice incumbent President Gabriel Boric will continue at the third forum to be held on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nFurthermore, at the third seminar on Chile's \"Future Foreign Policy Cycle\" in July 2021, China and its global economic integration project were among the main topics of discussion. Today, with an eye to 2030 -- to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals -- Chile and China find in the Belt and Road Initiative a plethora of possibilities for boosting cooperation and contributing to global economic recovery and improving global governance.\n\nFernando Reyes Matta is a former ambassador of Chile to China, and the director of the Center for Latin-American Studies on China, Universidad Andr\u00e9s Bello, Chile.\n\nTransport powering China-Africa cooperation\n\nSince 2016, the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation Nigeria Limited has completed five railway projects in Nigeria. The last one, Lagos Metro Blue Railway Line, was inaugurated in Lagos on Sept 4.\n\nThe 12-km-long Lagos Metro is the second subway in operation. It comprises the first phase of the 37-km-long railway in Nigeria.\n\nThe others are the 157-km-long Lagos-Ibadan railway which has an additional 7-km-long arm, the 42-km-long Abuja metro railway, the 186-km-long Abuja-Kaduna railway, and the 368-km-long Ajaokuta-Itakpe-Warri railway. These projects have contributed immensely to the revival of the moribund railway system in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2019, immediately after the pandemic broke out, the Nigerian Ministry of Transportation said the China-built railways had contributed greatly to improving transportation and making traveling less stressful.\n\nWhile covering the major Belt and Road projects and interviewing many people, I found that most of the passengers had never traveled by train in Nigeria before. Almost all the passengers said the coaches were comfortable and railway services efficient.\n\nSince 2019, the CCECC has completed and handed over many projects to the Nigerian authorities for operation. And while the international airports in Abuja have been renovated or upgraded, new terminals have been built in Kano, Port Harcourt and Lagos. These four projects are masterpieces in architecture.\n\nIn December last year, as a seal of approval for its quality work and for completing all projects on time, the CCECC was awarded the contract to build the 37-km-long Lagos Fourth Mainland Bridge at a cost of $2.5 billion, with much of the funding coming from the Export-Import Bank of China.\n\nIn January, another Chinese company, China Harbor Engineering Company, completed the Lekki Deep Seaport in Lagos -- the largest seaport in West Africa. All this shows the Belt and Road Initiative has made significant contributions to Nigeria's economic development.\n\nIkenna Emewu is editor-in-chief of Africa China Economy Magazine, Lagos Nigeria.\n\nBRI creates global ripples on the development front\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative promoted cooperation and development worldwide. Among the five major priorities of the initiative, infrastructure connectivity and people-to-people relations were the most successful in the past decade, even though policy coordination, unimpeded trade and financial integration fared well too.\n\nInfrastructure discourse topped the Belt and Road agenda since massive infrastructure-related projects were completed in China and abroad linking almost two-thirds of the world population from Africa to Asia and elsewhere, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Despite some false narratives on China's \"hidden agenda\" and \"debt trap\", the initiative has brought millions of people together through new projects along the ancient Silk Road, helping narrow the yawning gaps among countries for lack of communication and connectivity.\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative should offer two significant things in its second decade. The first is China's experience in eradicating poverty, and the second is its successful intervention in project development to the benefit of a large section of society.\n\nHowever, different communities have different experiences about such interventions. So the initiative should develop a model for this. It should also build a permanent headquarters so that scholars, practitioners and beneficiaries, and representatives of states and organizations can assemble on a platform to delve into global issues.\n\nAlso, the Belt and Road Initiative brings more scholars from the Global South on board for research and development. Such activities will ensure sustainability and inclusiveness of the Belt and Road projects, while triggering further debates on the existing modalities of research, target groups and academic discourses in order to build a community with a shared future for mankind.",

        "title": "Commentary: Belt and Road cooperation to hasten demise of \"neocolonialism\"",
        "body": "BEIJING, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- As the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) turns 10 years old, it is clear that the global project of the century has blazed a new development path of shared peace and prosperity.\n\nHowever, out of jealousy, apprehension or strategic considerations, some Western critics employ derogatory terms, such as \"neocolonialism,\" to describe the BRI in an attempt to undermine China's productive collaborations with partner countries.\n\nThe fact is, instead of being a form of neocolonialism, this project -- the biggest platform for international cooperation -- is actively expediting the dismantling of \"neocolonialism\" by bolstering essential independent development capacities of Global South countries. Many of these countries were colonized and remain trapped in the shadow of the neocolonialism of suzerains.\n\nNeocolonialism generally refers to the control that powerful capitalist countries exert over developing countries in fields like economy, finance, ideology and governance, with the aim of sustaining their exploitation of the latter. Eliminating this detrimental legacy is imperative in establishing an equitable and just international order.\n\nUnlike some Western countries, China has never colonized others. Like many countries, it was also a victim of imperialist invasions in its modern history. In its contemporary diplomacy, China treats all countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, as equal and does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.\n\nOne must never forget that the paramount tenet of jointly building the Belt and Road is extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. Extensive consultation is essential in fostering cooperation. Therefore, it is consistently emphasized that the BRI should align closely with the development strategies and plans of partner countries and regions. Project deals are finalized and implemented on the basis of consensus and joint efforts of all parties involved, aiming for high-standard, sustainable and livelihood-enhancing outcomes.\n\nSo-called \"debt trap\" is often cited to support the claims of \"Chinese neocolonialism.\" However, this argument lacks fundamental logic and primarily serves as a political tactic of certain countries to tarnish China's reputation and create divisions between China and its Belt and Road partners.\n\nDeveloping countries mainly borrow from commercial and multilateral lenders. According to the World Bank's International Debt Statistics, by the end of 2020, commercial and multilateral creditors accounted for 40 percent and 34 percent respectively for the public external debt of 82 low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Bilateral official creditors took up 26 percent and China less than 10 percent.\n\nDebt-trap diplomacy is a typical hallmark of Western powers, whose aid and high-interest loans with political strings attached should be blamed for the excessive debts accrued by some developing countries over the past decades.\n\nPoliticized discourse attaching the label of neocolonialism to the BRI is feeble and futile given the growing popularity and distinct success in the first 10 years of this initiative. The China-Laos Railway turned land-locked Laos into a land-linked country, which added over 100,000 jobs indirectly for the country and could raise Laos' aggregate income by 21 percent. The Mombasa-Nairobi Railway accounts for 2 percent of Kenya's economic growth.\n\nBuilding the Belt and Road is a major opening-up move for China in the new era, but it by no means only serves China's development. Rather, it offers other countries a platform to share China's development opportunities to promote shared growth. It values win-win outcomes and rejects one-sided advantages, thus aligning with the essence of creating a community with a shared future for humanity. Seeking sphere of influence or geopolitical interests is not China's purpose in promoting the BRI.\n\nGrandiose ideas proposed by some developed countries have often amounted to mere rhetoric with little substantive action. They indulge in building castles in the air in terms of \"support\" for developing countries, but China builds roads, ports, industrial parks, technical centers and wind and solar power plants for Belt and Road partner countries.\n\nThe BRI is an inclusive and open platform that welcomes all countries to engage in mutually beneficial cooperation for the collective development interests of all. By adopting the \"raising geese that lay golden eggs\" and \"teaching people to fish\" approaches, China aims to make a more significant contribution to assisting partner countries in their socioeconomic development so that they can unshackle themselves from neocolonial debt and other traps created by the West.\n\nNeocolonialism and hegemonism lead to nothing but an inescapable dead end. In contrast, the BRI is brimming with vitality as representatives of more than 140 countries gather in Beijing on Tuesday and Wednesday to jointly build fresh momentum and chart a new blueprint on advancing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation in the new phase.\n\nCertainly, challenges and difficulties may emerge during the course of Belt and Road cooperation. The third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation presents a significant opportunity for leaders and representatives to reflect on the productive past decade and deliberate on plans for a new decade of even greater productivity.",

        "title": "Geno Smith carried the blame but there were plenty of factors in why the Seahawks faltered",
        "body": "RENTON, Wash. (AP) -- If something doesn't go right, Seattle quarterback Geno Smith is usually quick to take the blame -- even if he's not completely at fault.\n\nThat was the case again Sunday after the Seahawks' frustrating 17-13 loss at Cincinnati where Smith had far from his best game.\n\nDespite throwing for 323 yards, Smith tossed two interceptions, missed a couple of big play opportunities and at times appeared hesitant to throw. He also took a costly sack in the fourth quarter that turned first-and-goal at the Cincinnati 7 into second-and-goal at the 19, one of four trips to the red zone where Seattle failed to come away with points and ultimately proved the difference.\n\n\"I felt like the guys deserved to win today. Obviously, I didn't do my best job today to get that done,\" Smith said. \"So those are things I put on myself, I lay right on my feet right, on my shoulders and I look forward to the next opportunity.\"\n\nSmith needed to be better in some critical moments, but he didn't need to shoulder all the blame for this loss. Seattle's makeshift offensive line finally showed leaks after somehow holding together the past few weeks with several starters out. One of Smith's interceptions was a miscommunication with DK Metcalf. And Seattle's play calling could have put Smith in a better position for some of those red zone trips that came up empty.\n\n\"We had so many ways to win in that football game and so many ways to score and opportunities that got squandered,\" Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. \"But there was just a lot of positives moving forward.\"\n\nWHAT'S WORKING\n\nSeattle defensive coordinator Clint Hurtt deserves recognition for the adjustments made in the second half that stifled Cincinnati's offense. The Bengals were held to three points, 52 total yards and four first downs in the second half by Seattle. The three points came after a turnover and a drive during which Cincinnati gained zero yards.\n\nCincinnati finished with 214 total yards, the second straight opponent Seattle has held under 250 yards of offense. The last time Seattle did that was Weeks 16 and 17 in 2015.\n\nThe focus this offseason was on improving the run defense and Seattle certainly has done that. The Bengals rushed for 46 yards and averaged 3.1 yards per rush. But the overall performance has to be an encouraging sign moving forward.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe offensive line was a mess in the second half and led to some of the problems Smith faced. Smith had been hit a total of 12 times during Seattle's three-game win streak. He was hit 13 times by the Bengals. The protection just wasn't there the way it needed to be, even with the return of left tackle Charles Cross after missing the previous three games with a toe injury.\n\nGetting guard Damien Lewis back this week from an ankle injury would help the interior of the line.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nJamal Adams made it through his first full game since Week 12 of the 2021 season. And on the surface he appeared to play well. Adams had four tackles, one tackle for loss and one QB hit, and played 85% of the defensive snaps.\n\nHis return in Week 4 from a torn quadriceps tendon that cost him more than a year lasted all of nine plays before suffering a concussion. Sunday was a much more satisfying return.\n\n\"That was the goal. I was just taking it one quarter at a time,\" Adams said. \"Obviously, I was on a little rep count. That was killing me to be on the sideline, but I understood the routine and I understood the plan. I feel great.\"\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nMetcalf continues to have an issue with committing undisciplined penalties. Metcalf was flagged for unnecessary roughness in the second quarter, getting penalized some 30 yards away from where the play took place. Metcalf also had a 15-yard taunting penalty in Week 1 and has five 15-yard penalties for unsportsmanlike conduct, unnecessary roughness or taunting in the past two seasons.\n\nINJURIES\n\nSeattle didn't appear to pick up any significant new injuries coming out of the loss, although the health of the offensive line will be closely watched. The Seahawks don't expect starting right tackle Abraham Lucas to be ready to return this week even though he's eligible to come off injured reserve.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n4 -- Seattle has lost its last four games following its bye week. Last year, it was a 40-34 overtime loss at home to Las Vegas. In 2021, the Seahawks lost 17-0 at Green Bay, and in 2020 it was a 37-34 overtime loss at Arizona. The last time Seattle won out of the bye was 2019 when it beat Philadelphia 17-9.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Seahawks will face an NFC West opponent for the first time since Week 1 when they host Arizona on Sunday. The Seahawks have won three straight in the series, but is just 2-2 in the past four meetings in Seattle.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

        "body": "Biden will head to Israel and Jordan as concerns mount that Israel-Hamas conflict will spread\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- President Joe Biden will travel to Israel and onto Jordan Wednesday to meet with both Israeli and Arab leadership, as concerns increase that the raging Israel-Hamas war could expand into a larger regional conflict.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Biden's travel to Israel as the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip grows more dire and as Israel prepares for a possible ground attack on the 141-square-mile (365-square-kilometer) territory to root out Hamas militants responsible for what U.S. and Israeli officials say was the most lethal assault against Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nBiden is looking to send the strongest message yet that the U.S. is behind Israel. His Democratic administration has pledged military support, sending U.S. carriers and aid to the region. Officials have said they would ask Congress for upward of $2 billion in additional aid for both Israel and Ukraine, which is fighting Russia's invasion.\n\nBlinken made the announcement early Tuesday after more than seven hours of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials.\n\nShortly after in Washington, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby announced that Biden would also go to Jordanto meet with King Abdullah, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nHumanitarian aid is stuck at Gaza-Egypt border as Israeli siege strains hospitals, water supply\n\nRAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Truckloads of aid idled at Egypt's border with Gaza as residents and humanitarian groups pleaded Monday for water, food and fuel for dying generators, saying the tiny Palestinian territory sealed off by Israel after last week's rampage by Hamas was near total collapse.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden will travel to Israel on Wednesday to signal White House support for the country and amid fears that Israel's war with Hamas could spread to other countries. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the trip early Tuesday in Tel Aviv following hours of talks with Israeli officials, and an invitation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIn Gaza, hospitals were on the verge of losing electricity, threatening the lives of thousands of patients, and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced from their homes searched for bread. Israel maintained punishing airstrikes across Gaza as a ground invasion loomed, while Hamas militants kept up a barrage of rocket attacks, and tensions mounted near the Israel-Lebanon border.\n\nMore than a week after Israel cut off entry of any supplies, all eyes were on the Rafah crossing, Gaza's only connection to Egypt. Mediators were trying to reach a cease-fire that would let in aid and let out trapped foreigners. Israeli airstrikes forced the crossing to shut down last week, but it remained unclear Monday which of the regional actors was keeping the crossing closed.\n\nBlinken said the U.S. and Israel had agreed to develop a plan to enable humanitarian aid to reach civilians in Gaza. There were few details, but the plan would include \"the possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm's way.\"\n\nMourners in heavily Palestinian Chicago suburb remember Muslim boy killed as kind, energetic\n\nBRIDGEVIEW, Ill. (AP) -- Crowds of mourners in a heavily Palestinian Chicago suburb paid respects Monday to a 6-year-old Muslim boy killed in an alleged hate crime, hours after authorities revealed new details about the evidence used to charge the family's landlord with stabbing the child and his mother.\n\nWadea Al-Fayoume, who had recently had a birthday, died Saturday after being stabbed dozens of times in a brutal attack that drew condemnation from local elected officials to the White House. Authorities said the family's landlord, Joseph Czuba, was upset over the Israel-Hamas war and attacked them after the boy's mother proposed they \"pray for peace.\"\n\nIn Bridgeview, which is home to a large and established Palestinian community, family and friends remembered Wadea as a kind and energetic boy who loved playing games. His body was carried in a small white casket -- which was at times draped with a Palestinian flag -- through packed crowds.\n\nMosque Foundation Imam Jamal Said reflected on the boy's death during the janazah, or funeral service, but also the wider loss of life in the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\"Wadea is a child and he is not the only one under attack,\" he said, adding many \"children are being slaughtered literally in the Holy Land, unfortunately, which is very sad.\"\n\nGunman kills two Swedes in Brussels, prompting terror alert and halt of Belgium-Sweden soccer match\n\nBRUSSELS (AP) -- Belgian police early Tuesday hunted for a gunman with suspected terrorist motives who killed two Swedes with stunning viciousness before disappearing into the night. He created such fear that authorities shut down a Belgium-Sweden soccer match and held 35,000 fans inside for several hours as a precaution.\n\nEric Van Duyse, spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office, said the investigation was centering on \"a possible terrorist motivation for the shooting\" after \"a claim of responsibility was posted on social media.\"\n\n\"This person claims to be inspired by Islamic State,\" Van Duyse said. \"The Swedish nationality of the victims was put forward as the probable motive.\" Sweden raised its terror alert to the second-highest level in August after a series of public Quran-burnings by an Iraqi refugee living in Sweden resulted in threats from Islamic militant groups.\n\n\"At this time, no element indicates a possible link with the Israeli-Palestinian situation,\" Van Duyse said, offering scant relief on a continent where many nations have increased their vigilance for fear of attacks linked to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIn Belgium, the anti-terror center said the terror alert in the capital was raised to its top rating of 4, meaning a \"threat is extremely serious.\" It previously stood at 2, which means the threat was average. The alert level or the rest of the country was raised to 2.\n\nGOP's Jim Jordan is shoring up support and peeling off detractors ahead of a House speaker vote\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- With a push by allies of Donald Trump, far-right firebrand Rep. Jim Jordan appeared Monday to be shoring up support to become U.S. House speaker, winning over reluctant Republicans who have few options left two weeks after Kevin McCarthy's ouster.\n\nOne by one, Jordan, the hard-charging Judiciary Committee chairman, has been peeling off detractors who view the Ohio Republican as too extreme. A major pressure campaign from Trump allies including Steve Bannon and Fox News' Sean Hannity has helped quickly build support. Tuesday's scheduled floor vote could turn into a showdown.\n\n\"I feel real good about the momentum we have,\" Jordan said outside his office in Washington.\n\nAhead of a private GOP meeting Monday evening, Jordan took a cooperative tone vowing to \"bring all Republicans together\" if he becomes House speaker after the ouster of McCarthy.\n\n\"The country and our conference cannot afford us attacking each other right now,\" Jordan wrote in a letter to colleagues. \"It is time we unite to get back to work on behalf of the American people.\"\n\nTrump has narrow gag order imposed on him by federal judge overseeing 2020 election subversion case\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal judge overseeing the 2020 election interference case against Donald Trump in Washington imposed a narrow gag order on him on Monday, barring the Republican former president from making statements targeting prosecutors, possible witnesses and court staff.\n\nThe order from U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan marks a milestone moment in the federal case that accuses Trump of illegally conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. It's the most serious restriction a court has placed on Trump's incendiary rhetoric, which has become a centerpiece of his grievance-filled campaign to return to the White House while fighting criminal charges in four cases.\n\nThe order may end a line of attack that Trump has made central to his campaign for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. But it may be only the beginning of an unprecedented fight over what limits can be a placed on the speech of a defendant who is also campaigning for America's highest public office.\n\nIn a social media post shortly after the hearing in Washington's federal court, Trump vowed to appeal. During a campaign appearance in Iowa later Monday, Trump decried the order as unconstitutional, and claimed it would only help him in the polls.\n\nSpeaking from the bench, Chutkan said Trump is entitled to criticize the Justice Department generally and assert his belief that the case is politically motivated but can't mount a \"smear campaign\" against prosecutors and court personnel.\n\nTim Scott praises 'restraint' of Israel's Netanyahu, says US should move more firepower to region\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina on Monday praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for showing what he called \"restraint\" after Hamas attacked Israel over a week ago.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate said Netanyahu \"waited\" and showed \"patience\" and \"humanity\" in response to the Oct. 7 attack.\n\nIsrael launched airstrikes in Gaza the day of the attack and Netanyahu declared war with Hamas, vowing to inflict an \"unprecedented price.\" The war has become the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides, with more than 4,000 dead.\n\n\"One of the first things that Israel's done is they waited,\" Scott said about Israel as he spoke at an event focused on U.S. foreign policy and national security at Georgetown University in Washington.\n\n\"Now how Prime Minister Netanyahu had the kind of restraint to refrain from immediate action, it just talks about the morality and the humanity that we see coming from Netanyahu into Gaza,\" the senator said.\n\nEcuador's youngest elected president faces a practically impossible task\n\nQUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador 's youngest elected president on Monday faced the practically impossible task of reducing a terrifying, drug-driven crime wave within a greatly shortened 1 1/2 years in office.\n\nDaniel Noboa, 35, is an heir to one of Ecuador's largest fortunes thanks to a global empire built on bananas -- the country's main crop.\n\nHis voters were, among other things, frightened by the escalation of drug violence over the past three years. Killings, kidnappings, robberies and other criminal activities have become part of everyday life, leaving Ecuadorians wondering when, not if, they will be victims.\n\nThe spike in violence is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. Mexican, Colombian and Balkan cartels have set down roots in Ecuador and operate with assistance from local criminal gangs.\n\nPresidential candidate and anti-corruption crusader Fernando Villavicencio was assassinated in August. Since then, other politicians and political leaders have been killed or kidnapped, car bombs have exploded in multiple cities, including the capital, Quito, and inmates have rioted in prisons. Earlier this month, seven men held as suspects in Villavicencio's slaying were killed inside prisons.\n\nRite Aid seeks Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as it deals with lawsuits and losses\n\nRite Aid has filed for bankruptcy protection and plans to sell part of its business as it attempts to restructure while dealing with losses and opioid-related lawsuits.\n\nThe company said Rite Aid stores will continue to fill prescriptions, and customers will still be able to visit its locations or shop online while it goes through its voluntary Chapter 11 process. But that process also will allow it to speed up its plan to close underperforming stores.\n\nGoing through Chapter 11 will help \"significantly reduce the company's debt\" while helping to \"resolve litigation claims in an equitable manner,\" Rite Aid late Sunday.\n\nRite Aid Corp. said in its federal bankruptcy filing that it runs more than 2,000 stores. Most of its locations are on the East and West Coasts.\n\nThe Philadelphia company, which is marking its 60th year in business, has posted annual losses for several years and has been cutting costs and closing stores as it dealt with long-standing financial challenges. It has said it expects a net loss of as much as $680 million in the current fiscal year, which will end next spring.\n\nRangers build big early lead off Valdez, hold on for 5-4 win over Astros to take 2-0 lead in ALCS\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Jonah Heim homered, Nathan Eovaldi pitched six effective innings and the Texas Rangers beat Framber Valdez and Houston Astros 5-4 on Monday for a 2-0 lead in the AL Championship Series.\n\nAdolis Garc\u00eda, Mitch Garver and Nathaniel Lowe each hit an RBI single during Texas' four-run first inning against Valdez, and Jos\u00e9 Leclerc closed it out for the Rangers after Yordan Alvarez powered an Astros rally.\n\nEovaldi struck out nine, including two in a row after Houston loaded the bases with none out in the fifth. He was charged with three runs and five hits in his third win this postseason.\n\nThe Rangers improved to 7-0 in the playoffs, including six wins on the road. They swept the Rays in the Wild Card Series and the Orioles in the Division Series, and then posted a 2-0 win at Houston in the ALCS opener.\n\nGame 3 of the best-of-seven series is Wednesday night in Arlington.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

        "body": "On Sunday, the San Francisco 49ers showcased their offensive potential with impressive bookend drives against the Cleveland Browns. The team scored on its opening drive and positioned themselves for a potential game-winning field goal, which rookie Jake Moody missed.\n\nHowever, much of what transpired between those two drives was uninspiring. After looking like a well-oiled machine for much of the season, quarterback Brock Purdy and the offense struggled to gain momentum against the NFL's top-ranked defense.\n\nPart of this struggle can be attributed to the absence of wide receiver Deebo Samuel and running back Christian McCaffrey. Samuel sustained a shoulder injury in the first quarter, while McCaffrey left the game with an oblique/rib injury in the third. Samuel is day-to-day, and the 49ers await McCaffrey's test results.\n\nHead coach Kyle Shanahan acknowledged the challenges of overcoming the loss of two star players but believes other things contributed to the team's struggles on Sunday.\n\n\"Any time you lose real good players like that, it's a challenge,\" Shanahan told reporters via a conference call on Monday afternoon. \"But that's stuff you got to go through. That's part of football. I just thought we made too many mistakes, missed assignments and stuff once that happened, because when that does happen, you got to put some guys in some different positions, stuff that you don't always put them through, but they're responsible for studying.\"\n\nShanahan's frustrations on the sidelines were repeatedly evident throughout Sunday's television broadcast. The 49ers' miscues were underscored by their season-high 12 penalties, twice that of any single game since Week 1's 11-penalty performance.\n\nObviously, missing two of their biggest playmakers didn't help matters. Some of the fault may fall on the coaching staff, too.\n\n\"And that's on everybody,\" Shanahan continued. \"But also, when it got to that situation, I thought we should have made it easier for those guys because I think it would have been all right if we don't lose those guys, but with the amount of mistakes we made in the game, obviously we had too much on them.\"",

        "title": "The Pats, at 1-5 for 1st time under Belichick, taking small improvements back to the drawing board",
        "body": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) -- Over three weeks and three straight losses, Mac Jones has walked into the Patriots team facility ready to face the kind of truths only game film can reveal.\n\nIt's been difficult to watch and many of the same themes continue to pop up each week -- turnovers, penalties and poor fundamentals.\n\nYet as much as the season seems to be slipping way with each passing game, it hasn't affected the third-year quarterback's resolve to help his team find a way out of its current malaise.\n\n\"We definitely need to improve but have to keep swinging,\" Jones said. \"If you don't swing, you're not going to get any hits. Definitely going to keep swinging.\"\n\nSunday's 21-17 setback at Las Vegas has dropped the Patriots to 1-5 for the first time under Bill Belichick.\n\nThey remain in last place in the AFC East, with back-to-back matchups against the division's top two teams up next.\n\nWhile many of the issues that need to be corrected are clear, what's also undeniable is that New England's problems are being exacerbated by mounting injuries.\n\nThe Patriots ended the practice week with a season-high 17 players on the injury report. By Sunday seven of those players were declared out, including left guard Cole Strange (knee) and receivers JuJu Smith-Schuster (concussion) and Demario Douglas (concussion).\n\nDespite center David Andrews and left tackle Trent Brown being the only two healthy regular starters on the offensive line, the group did manage to help end what had grown to a 12-quarter touchdown drought. It came via Ezekiel Elliott's 2-yard TD run in the third quarter.\n\nBut it followed yet another slow start by the Patriots that put them in a double-digit hole. It marked the fifth time this season the Patriots have trailed to open a game.\n\nIt's a recurring theme that coach Bill Belichick acknowledged he hasn't been able to figure out.\n\n\"If I had the answer to that question, then maybe it wouldn't be that way,\" Belichick said. \"We've tried a number of different things, and we'll keep working on it. ... It's been hard to play from behind. It's not the way you want to play in this league or really any competitive sport I can think of. We've got to do a better job of that, there's no doubt about it.\"\n\nWHAT'S WORKING\n\nDefense. Despite being without linebacker Matt Judon and cornerback Christian Gonzalez for the second straight week, New England's defenders kept the Patriots in the game, holding the Raiders to just one touchdown on six chances inside the 20-yard line.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nTeam discipline. The Patriots finished with a season-high 10 penalties for 79 yards. The offense accounted for six of them, the fifth time this season that unit was responsible for the majority of the team's infractions.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nLinebacker Jahlani Tavai. He was in the right place at the right time in the first quarter, pulling in an interception off a ricochet when Ja'Whaun Bentley broke up a pass intended for Davante Adams and knocked the ball into the air.\n\nIt was the Patriots' first turnover in four games. The three-game drought had been tied for the longest in franchise history.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nTight end Hunter Henry. His holding penalty in the second quarter nullified a 74-yard catch-and-run touchdown by Elliott. It would have been the longest play of the season for New England. Henry is usually a top option for Mac Jones. But he was a non-factor offensively, catching just one of his three targets for 7 yards.\n\nINJURIES\n\nDefensive end Keion White left the game with a head injury in the first quarter. Cornerback Jonathan Jones left with a knee issue. Henry (ankle) and linebacker Josh Uche (foot) were both hurt in the second half.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n0-3 -- Belichick's record against former assistant Josh McDaniels. McDaniels beat his former boss once as Denver's coach in 2009 and has done it with the Raiders each of the past two seasons.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Patriots host the Bills on Sunday. Including the playoffs, Buffalo has won the past four meetings.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

        "title": "Will Xi Jinping's gamble on Vladimir Putin pay off?",
        "body": "The last time Russian President Vladimir Putin set foot on Chinese soil he went home with the promise of a \"no limits\" partnership from President Xi Jinping. Less than a month later he launched the invasion of Ukraine. He is set to return to Beijing this week in a diminished state, needing the economic support of China and a route out of his self-inflicted political isolation.\n\nThe meeting between the two presidents will inevitably be overshadowed by Israel's conflict with the Gaza-based militant group Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the European Union. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged China at the weekend to use its friendly ties with Iran -- which supports Hamas -- and broader influence in the Middle East to prevent the conflict from escalating. The pressure on Xi, and indirectly Putin, who is also close to Tehran, to act over the crisis is likely to intensify.\n\nFor now, the two leaders are expected to focus on their growing relationship. Russia's reliance on China has reached into every facet of its economy in the 20 months since the invasion of Ukraine. With the West severing trade ties, China's exports to Russia have jumped 57% so far this year. The yuan accounted for almost half of the value of all foreign exchange trading in Moscow in September -- up from just 0.4% in January 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Economics. China is now the largest importer of fossil fuels from Russia, with coal shipments more than doubling since 2020.\n\nThe Russian leader's attendance at Xi's Belt and Road Initiative Forum, which opens on Tuesday, will be his first trip abroad -- aside from visiting former Soviet states -- since the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against him in March for alleged war crimes in Ukraine. The visit will allow Russia to cement this critical economic support and apply pressure on Beijing to sign agreements on a new gas pipeline.\n\nFor his part, Xi is seeking a reliable Russia to be a powerful partner in building his vision of an alternative world order. One based on an age-old mutual distrust of the West -- especially the U.S. and its military allies -- and a desire to reinforce its own position on the island of Taiwan, which it views as a breakaway province, but which Washington has committed to support.\n\nPutin is a key part of that. Indeed, if China were to invade Taiwan -- a prospect that is unlikely anytime soon -- Russia could prove crucial in ensuring supplies of food and fuel and potentially providing political cover at the United Nations Security Council.\n\nBut there is disquiet among some experts and academics in Beijing who think China is getting little from the relationship beyond a new market for some of its cars, televisions and smartphones and knock-down prices for Russian oil and gas. This has led to questions over whether Beijing has gambled too much on the Russian leader.\n\n\"I think Putin is not an ideal partner for Xi Jinping -- he hoped for much more,\" said Jakub Jakobowski, deputy director at the Centre for Eastern Studies in Warsaw. \"He's increasingly a burden for Xi internally for those parts of the Chinese elite that don't want to subscribe to this big affair that Russia has started.\"\n\nXi is looking to strike a balance, which has become more difficult the longer the conflict has dragged on. He hasn't provided any major military aid to Russia that would provoke U.S. sanctions against China, and he's warned against both the use of nuclear weapons and attacks on civilians. Unlike Putin, who is treated as a pariah by the West, Xi wants a stable relationship with the U.S. and appears likely to meet President Joe Biden in November. But his refusal to explicitly condemn the invasion has undermined Beijing's claim to neutrality and reinforced skepticism among some Group of Seven countries of its 12-point peace proposal to resolve the Ukraine crisis.\n\nThe Chinese leader's peace push did win him some credibility among emerging economies like Brazil. Indeed, he spent the early part of the year trying to act as a global peacemaker helping long-time rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran reach a diplomatic truce. He later proposed an Israel-Palestine peace conference which is why he is now being urged to take a role in calming the conflict with Hamas. Beijing has called for a ceasefire, but beyond that its influence is unclear. For Putin, the conflict could be useful if it means Western powers and public attention are distracted away from the fighting in Ukraine.\n\nXi has more immediate worries at home. An economic slowdown raises the potential for more social unrest. Both the foreign and defense ministers appear to have been ousted in recent months, and there has been an overhaul of the generals responsible for China's Rocket Force, which manages the nation's nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe U.S. is tightening export curbs on advanced technology, the E.U. is probing China's electric vehicle subsidies and some Asian neighbors have ramped up military spending amid a rise in tensions over Taiwan. The E.U.'s chief trade negotiator, Valdis Dombrovskis, has warned that China's stance on Ukraine is hurting the appetite of businesses to invest in the world's second-biggest economy.\n\nBeijing is \"wary that as long as people continue to put China and Russia in the same category, they will actually burn the bridge to Europe, the U.S. and others,\" said Ngeow Chow Bing, director of the Institute of China Studies at the University of Malaya, who has written extensively on Chinese politics. \"China wants to present itself as someone that both sides can rely on.\"\n\nPutin was the first foreign leader that Xi visited after he became China's president in 2013. And over the past decade the two have often been described as having a close relationship, despite not sharing a common language. In 2019 they celebrated Xi's birthday together in Tajikistan: Putin gave the Chinese leader a gift of a box of ice cream popsicles. The two presidents -- who have both changed their country's rules to allow them the opportunity to extend their time in power -- last met in Moscow in March, just days after the ICC issued its arrest warrant against Putin. In an interview broadcast on Russian TV on Monday, Putin said of his relationship with Xi: \"If we agree on something, we can be sure that both sides will keep their end of the bargain.\"\n\nYet, there also exists, said a Europe-based diplomat, an element of sibling rivalry in the dynamic between the two leaders, a nod to a time when the Soviet Union was regarded as the \"big brother\" in the relationship. That is no longer the case.\n\nRelations between the countries have often been strained -- sometimes openly hostile. In 1969 border clashes prompted the Soviet Union to threaten the use of atomic weapons against China. That \"nuclear blackmail\" is one reason Beijing will oppose any similar Russian threats in Ukraine, according to Wang Yiwei, a former Chinese diplomat to the E.U.\n\nAnother \"red line\" for Beijing, he added, is the principle of territorial sovereignty enshrined in the U.N. charter. That's something China regularly uses to bolster its claim to Taiwan. And although Xi appears to share Putin's concerns about the expansion of NATO, that doesn't signal all-out support for Russia.\n\nThose backing Moscow, said Wang, are not \"supporting Russia's territorial seizure\" but rather celebrating \"Russians with their behavior against Western hegemony.\" Wang, now an influential academic and director of Renmin University's Institute of International Affairs added: \"Many people hate Russia and criticize Russia.\"\n\nOne area of tension has been China's Belt and Road initiative -- Xi's landmark foreign policy program to expand Beijing's influence through projects now valued at $1 trillion -- which has made inroads into Central Asia, Russia's backyard.\n\nFor now, Russia can do little about the imbalance in relations. \"Moscow badly needs Beijing's co-operation to keep its economy afloat,\" said Alexander Isakov, an economist who covers Russia at Bloomberg Economics. \"Moscow will have to shoulder most of the costs.\"\n\nThe growth in bilateral trade with Russia is a rare bright spot for China, as policymakers try to kickstart growth in the sluggish economy. Increased exports to Russia are partly attributable to Chinese consumer goods companies filling the gap vacated by Western brands who fled the country after sanctions were imposed. Shipments of made-in-China vehicles, parts and accessories jumped to about $14 billion in the first eight months of this year, a more than five-fold increase from the same period in 2021, according to data from China's General Administration of Customs.\n\nLonger-term, Moscow needs Beijing to invest in domestic manufacturing. Sectors like the automobile industry need help to fill the gap left by Western companies. Just eight out of Russia's 14 passenger-car plants are operational. Smaller Chinese car manufacturers already produce in Russia, but to return output to pre-invasion levels of about 1.4 million cars, from 451,000 in 2022, another two or three major companies would need to set up assembly lines in Russia, according to Bloomberg Economics analysis.\n\n\"For Russia, closer integration with China is a necessity -- it needs to find a replacement for technology, capital that has previously been provided from the E.U. and other G-7 countries,\" said Isakov. \"For China, the risk is that capital invested in Russia may lose value when and if sanctions on Moscow are relaxed or lifted and its producers will have to compete for the market share with G-7 car manufacturers again.\"\n\nBeijing is providing respite for Moscow's most pressing financial worries. It has become the main buyer of cheap Russian oil and gas in the absence of European customers. China bought about $37.5 billion of crude oil from Russia in the first eight months of 2023 according to Chinese trade data. At the end of 2022, coal shipments had risen to over 64 million tons, an annual record that's set to be shattered this year after imports topped 70 million tons between January and August.\n\nAt the same time as providing this financial lifeline, Beijing is holding out for a more favorable deal from Moscow over the proposed natural gas pipeline, Power of Siberia 2. Moscow frequently talks up the prospects of an imminent agreement, but Beijing has been far more reticent and no contracts have been signed. Analysts expect Russia to push for more deals and cooperation agreements this week.\n\nThe internationalization of the yuan, which makes up just 3% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, is viewed by Beijing as another front in its efforts to challenge U.S. dominance of the global financial system. Russia's use of the yuan in export payments surged to 29% in August from zero prior to the invasion, while it made up 38% of imports versus 4% over the same period, the data show.\n\nBut Beijing can't press its advantage too hard, according to Yun Sun, senior fellow and co-director of the East Asia program at the Stimson Center think-tank. \"Russia's current strategic quagmire will not last forever,\" she said. \"For Beijing, the focus is not necessarily how much Russia is ready to give, but what costs China has to carry.\"\n\n(With assistance from Clara Ferreira Marques, Sarah Chen, Jason Rogers, James Mayger, Linda Lew, Lucille Liu, Jill Elaine Disis, Tom Orlik, Chang Shu, Jennifer Welch, Fran Wang and Xiao Zibang.)\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.

        "body": "Photos show how a once iconic building that was converted into luxury flats has fallen into a state of disrepair.\n\nSpembly Works, in New Road, Chatham, was a beacon of modern architecture when it was built in the 1950s.\n\nThe former factory, designed to look like a cruise ship, commands a prominent position on the town's skyline, with far-reaching views over the River Medway.\n\nHaving apparently fulfilled its potential with its conversion into homes in the early 2000s, its fortunes have taken a turn for the worse, having become an eyesore and a magnet for antisocial behaviour.\n\nLast week, 12ft high metal fences were being installed in an effort to keep intruders out.\n\nLandlord Andy Wicking said: \"We have organised for the building to be secured with security railings to stop anyone getting hurt and to hopefully stop any further damage.\"\n\nIt comes after the flats, vacated by its tenants after a prohibition order issued following the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 made it illegal to live there, were wrecked by vandals.\n\nThe structure is now a sorry sight, plastered in graffiti with smashed windows and fire-damaged interiors.\n\nNeighbour Beryl Payne is one of many who have been looking on in despair.\n\n\"Rough sleepers have moved in,\" she said. \"It is a playground for idle teenagers who trash the building.\n\n\"The ground around the building looks like a garbage dump and is ankle-deep in unsavoury litter.\n\n\"It has been boarded up again and again. Fires have been lit.\"\n\nIn April, police were called after youths broke in.\n\nOfficers made inquiries but those responsible have never been found.\n\nMr Wicking said: \"There is always trouble in there but the police won't go in because they say there is asbestos in the roof. There isn't.\n\n\"We keep boarding it up but people just break into it again.\"\n\nAnyone hoping to see progress being made in the near future to repair the damage is likely to be disappointed.\n\nThe landlord and tenants are trapped in a legal battle - a catch 22 which ultimately means there is no money to pay for the necessary work.\n\nMr Wicking said: \"The building now needs \u00a33 million of work done to it and might not even be structurally sound anymore.\n\n\"It has basically been completely gutted. You can't even tell it was made up of 33 separate flats.\"\n\nHe added: \"The future is still unknown at this stage but we continue to work tirelessly to bring much-needed housing back into use.\"",

        "body": "HOUSTON -- No matter the place or the moment, the Texas Rangers are rolling right now.\n\nJonah Heim homered, Nathan Eovaldi pitched six effective innings and Texas beat Framber Valdez and the Houston Astros 5-4 on Monday for a 2-0 lead in the AL Championship Series.\n\nThe Rangers improved to 7-0 in the playoffs, including six wins on the road. They swept the Rays in the Wild Card Series and the Orioles in the Division Series, and then posted a 2-0 win at Houston in the ALCS opener.\n\n''It's just baseball to us,'' Texas third baseman Josh Jung said. ''We're jumping on teams early, and that helps us settle in. Our pitching has been outstanding. You can't ask for anything more than what they've given us.''\n\nAdolis Garc\u00eda, Mitch Garver and Nathaniel Lowe each hit an RBI single during Texas' four-run first inning against Valdez, and Jos\u00e9 Leclerc closed it out for the Rangers after Yordan Alvarez powered an Astros rally.\n\nEovaldi struck out nine, including two in a row after Houston loaded the bases with none out in the fifth. He was charged with three runs and five hits in his third win this postseason.\n\n''You're talking about one of the elite pitchers in the game,'' Texas manager Bruce Bochy said. ''They have that ability to turn up a notch when they had to. We made an error, bases loaded, and it's about picking each other up, and he picked us up there and made great pitches.''\n\nGame 3 of the best-of-seven series is Wednesday night in Arlington.\n\nThe Rangers are the fifth team in MLB history and first since the Astros last season to win their first seven postseason games. Kansas City holds the record with an eight-game win streak to start the 2014 postseason.\n\nThe six straight road playoff wins by the Rangers is tied for the second-longest such streak in MLB history, behind an eight-game streak by the Yankees in 1996.\n\nAlvarez hit two solo drives to become the sixth player in MLB history to have two multihomer games in one postseason. The second one was off Aroldis Chapman, trimming Houston's deficit to 5-4 with two out in the eighth.\n\nLeclerc then came in and walked Jos\u00e9 Abreu and Michael Brantley, but Chas McCormick grounded out to end the threat.\n\nJeremy Pe\u00f1a flied out to deep right field for the first out in the Houston ninth. Yainer Diaz then grounded out and Jose Altuve flied to center, giving Leclerc his second save of the series.\n\nThe Astros, who went 39-42 at home in the regular season, continued to struggle at Minute Maid Park. The defending champions fell to 1-3 at home in the playoffs this year.\n\nThe Rangers jumped all over Valdez. Marcus Semien smacked the first pitch to center field for a single. Corey Seager singled to left on the second pitch before Valdez made two errors on one play.\n\nValdez bobbled a chopper hit by Robbie Grossman for an error that allowed him to reach first and Semien to score. His second error occurred when he badly overthrew first to move Grossman to second and Seager to third.\n\nValdez put his hands on his knees and shook his head at the end of the play.\n\nGarc\u00eda then hit a liner to right field to score Seager. Garver singled home another run before Valdez finally got his first out when he struck out Heim.\n\nThe Rangers weren't done yet.\n\nLowe singled on a ground ball to left to make it 4-0. Valdez retired the next two batters to end the inning.\n\n''I thought my pitches were good,'' he said through a translator. ''Maybe they got a little bit lucky. There were a couple of balls that weren't hit that well for base hits.''\n\nAlex Bregman also homered for the Astros, who went 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position. Alvarez, who is dealing with an illness, looked much better than he did in Game 1 when he went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts.\n\nHe said he was feeling good Monday and deflected questions about his health.\n\n''It was just something personal,'' he said through a translator. ''I don't know how that got out. It didn't come from me or the team.''\n\nValdez (0-2) allowed seven hits and five runs -- four earned -- in 2 2/3 innings in his second loss this postseason. It was his shortest start of the season.\n\nThe Astros missed a huge opportunity in the fifth. Brantley and McCormick hit back-to-back singles to open the inning before Pe\u00f1a reached on an error by Jung.\n\nBut Eovaldi escaped by striking out pinch-hitter Diaz and Altuve before Bregman grounded out.\n\n''When I was ahead 1-2 (on Altuve) and I went with a high fastball and followed it up with the splitter. You're close but you're not out of the woods yet because Bregman is equally as talented,'' Eovaldi said. ''I was able to make a good pitch and get us out of the jam, and I felt like that was one of the turning points of the game.''\n\nAlvarez walked with one out in the sixth before scoring on a two-out double by Brantley. Alvarez also hit a leadoff homer in the second into the second deck in right field.\n\nHeim homered high off the wall in left field to push the lead to 5-1 with no outs in the third.\n\nMax Scherzer will start for Texas in Game 3 after sitting out since Sept. 12 because of a muscle strain in his shoulder. It will be the fifth different team that the three-time Cy Young Award winner has pitched for in the postseason.\n\nCristian Javier starts for Houston after throwing five scoreless innings to get the win in Game 3 of the Division Series.",

        "title": "No Jefferson means Vikings might have to win ugly. That's just what they did in his 1st absence",
        "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The first game for the Minnesota Vikings without Justin Jefferson was a slog, a glaring reminder of how vital the superstar wide receiver is for their ability to score.\n\nThe Vikings also suggested in Chicago that acumen, grit and pride might be just enough to keep the season alive while Jefferson is sidelined with a hamstring injury -- even if it's going to be ugly at times.\n\n\"We're not going to be picky about finding a way to get a win,\" quarterback Kirk Cousins said.\n\nThe Vikings had 220 yards, their fifth-lowest total in 56 regular season games since Jefferson arrived in 2020. Their 15.4% third-down conversion rate was their fourth-worst in that span, and even after the game the Bears defense still ranks last in the league on third down (50.6%).\n\n\"It was kind of a revolving door of missed assignments here from some of our more reliable players,\" coach Kevin O'Connell said after the 19-13 victory Sunday. \"Our offense will be hungry to go back to work and make sure we rectify some of those things, because honestly the way Kirk was throwing it today, I feel like it could have been a much, much bigger day.\"\n\nThe Bears frequently employed a single high safety rather than the two-deep alignment most common for opponents trying to control Jefferson, daring Jordan Addison, K.J. Osborn and the rest of Minnesota's receivers to beat man-to-man coverage.\n\nAddison did just that midway through the second quarter with the Vikings ahead 6-3, when Cousins zipped a perfectly placed pass up the sideline on the first down, but he slightly mistimed his dive and didn't secure the ball as he landed on the grass.\n\nThe rookie contributed the only offensive touchdown of the afternoon for the Vikings (2-4) two possessions later, his fourth in six games, but the drop was a snapshot of how Jefferson's absence places a greater burden on the rest of the group to outperform their baseline production with the 2022 AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year out for at least another three games.\n\n\"I just need to be more aggressive from the start,\" Addison said. \"What I need to improve on is just attacking the ball, coming back to the ball and just showing people that they can't guard me.\"\n\nWHAT'S WORKING\n\nThe pass rush directed by defensive coordinator Brian Flores -- who blitzed on 22 of 29 dropbacks, per Sportradar -- produced five sacks and eight quarterback hits. Danielle Hunter had two sacks and is tied for the NFL lead with eight. Safety Josh Metellus, playing frequently out of the slot as the nickel back, had a sack, three quarterback hits and a forced fumble.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nAlexander Mattison netted just 44 yards on 18 carries in a regression for the rushing attack after a couple of productive games. The lanes often weren't there between the tackles.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nLinebacker Jordan Hicks had an interception and a fumble recovery for a touchdown to go with a team-leading 10 tackles. He has helped stabilize the defense this season following the departure of mainstay Eric Kendricks.\n\n\"He was not going to be denied a chance to be the guy to go out there and respond,\" O'Connell said.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nFullback C.J. Ham is one of the most respected players on the team, but his presence as a blocker hasn't done much for the lagging ground game. He also contributed to an intentional grounding call on Cousins in the fourth quarter when he stayed with the rusher instead of turning to try to catch a screen pass.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nOLB Marcus Davenport, who missed most or all of three games with an injury to his right ankle, hurt the other one in the second quarter against the Bears and didn't return. O'Connell indicated his absence might be longer term. ... LG Ezra Cleveland hurt his foot and was replaced by Dalton Risner. His status is day to day, O'Connell said on Monday.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n26:15 -- The average time of possession per game for the Vikings this season. That's the lowest in the league and also the lowest for the team since at least 1991, according to available data from Sportradar.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Vikings host San Francisco on Monday night, with the 49ers coming off their first loss of the season in a concerning game at Cleveland during which three vital offensive players -- running back Christian McCaffrey, wide receiver Deebo Samuel and left tackle Trent Williams -- suffered injuries that make their availability this week unclear.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

        "title": "Transcript: What Kyle Shanahan said the day after 49ers' Week 6 loss vs. Browns",
        "body": "San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan spoke with reporters via a conference call on Monday, the day after the team's 19-17 loss to the Cleveland Browns. Here is everything he had to say.\n\nTranscript provided by the San Francisco 49ers Communications staff.\n\nOpening comments:\n\n\"All right guys. Injuries from the game: [RB] Christian McCaffrey, oblique-rib, he's actually in MRIs right now, so we're still waiting on the imaging, [S] George Odum quad contusion, he'll be day-to-day, [WR] Deebo Samuel's shoulder, he'll be day-to-day, [T] Trent Williams, ankle, he'll be day-to-day. From last week, [LB Dre] Greenlaw with his hamstring, we expect to get him back for practice this week. Go ahead.\"\n\nIs Trent Williams a high ankle sprain?\n\n\"No, it's not a high ankle sprain.\"\n\nWith Christian McCaffrey, obviously QB Brock Purdy had a oblique-rib last year and you guys were able to protect him in various ways. Can you do the same thing with running back, flak jacket, that sort of thing?\n\n\"Yeah, I mean it's obviously a tougher position just because you get hit a lot more. But we've just got to see how it reacts. We've got to see exactly what's wrong with it too because we haven't got that back yet. So, we say oblique/rib, hopefully it's not both, but we've got to wait to see for sure.\"\n\nWere you able to get a handle on when exactly both Christian and Deebo got hurt and what happened on the plays that got them hurt?\n\n\"Yeah, Deebo was the first play of the game on the jet sweep. He just took a shot on the shoulder. It didn't look overly big or anything, it just connected right. And so it got him after that. If you watch him like the next eight plays and stuff, you could just tell his feeling was starting to go because he couldn't use his left arm. He tried to come back and stuff, but just couldn't get feeling back in it. So we had to shut him down. Christian we're not sure about. He mentioned about four possible plays he thought he could've done it on, but we're not sure which one he did.\"\n\nAfter watching the film, what did Cleveland Browns defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz do to limit Brock Purdy's effectiveness?\n\n\"I mean, they played aggressive man coverage. We knew that going into it. They had a couple of pressures that got us, we had a couple mistakes that got us in really negative situations. We had two drives in that game that didn't have a negative play. That was the first drive that we scored a touchdown and it was the last drive where we ended up missing that field goal. We got in some negative situations where we had second-and-long and third-and-long. And then with that pass rush and the tight coverages, that makes it really tough on a quarterback. So I think just as a team wholly, just getting into some of those bad situations made Brock's job a lot tougher. But he mixed it up throughout the game, did a good job. It was tough on film going in and it was tough during the game too.\"\n\nGoing back to Deebo, he already had imaging and X-rays, what's the extent of that shoulder? Is it a bruise or an AC joint?\n\n\"Yeah, that's what we're saying day-to-day. We've got to see how it recovers this week. It's just how his body's going to handle it. You never know how those react. So we'll wait and see.\"\n\nYou talked about yesterday that the adjustment you guys had to make with both of those guys out to not just lose potentially Christian, but he and Deebo for whatever length of time. How much of a challenge is that given their prominence in your offense?\n\n\"I mean, anytime you lose real good players like that, it's a challenge. But that's stuff you've got to go through. That's part of football. I just thought we made too many mistakes, missed assignments and stuff once that happened. When that does happen, you've got to put some guys in some different positions, stuff that you don't always put them through, but they're responsible for studying and that's on everybody. But also when it got to that situation, I thought we should have made it easier for those guys because I think it would've been alright if we didn't lose those guys. But with the amount of mistakes we made in the game, obviously we had too much on them.\"\n\nFollowing up on my question from yesterday about the run defense after the game, now that you've had the chance to watch the film, what was your appraisal of the run defense and maybe some ideas on what they can do to improve?\n\n\"Yeah, I was disappointed in it. I'm not sure the exact stat compared to the others, but if I had to guess it was our most missed tackles on the year. I thought they got our edges way too much, just blocking down on our D-Ends and getting around. We played a lot more two-shell defense and when you play two-shell defense you're a little bit behind in the run game. But we've been able to stop guys pretty good in that way. When they got our ends and we didn't get our safeties downhill, they bled us out too much. And when you add on a couple of those missed tackles and everything, it was way too much. Especially when you've got a quarterback coming in who hasn't started yet the best way to make that guy uncomfortable is to take away the run game and with 160 yards in that, we obviously didn't. That was disappointing, especially on those last two drives.\"\n\nWhen you guys took over still leading 17-16 with 3:21 left, what did you see in the way the Browns were playing that prompted you to throw the ball three times there and as a result only running off 25 seconds?\n\n\"Well, you don't plan on throwing it three times in a row. You don't plan on getting intentional grounding on the first one. So, second-and-20 you run. I'm not really worried about time when you have a one point lead and three-something left. If you get a first down and everything, then time can become a factor. But regardless of the timeouts in the game you know you're going to throw it one of those downs so you're not thinking totally about the clock. Yeah, you'd love to stay in bounds and love to do all that, but the clock's not going to matter until you get a first down. So everything's about trying to get a first down and they were blitzing us and stuff and we thought we'd have a really quick pass to [WR Brandon] Aiyuk on the first-and-10, which is exactly what we got. We just made a mistake in where we sent our back, which made Aiyuk covered on a hot, unblocked throw, which put Brock in a bad position where he had to just get rid of it. So we made a mistake on that play and then that's why we got intentional grounding. And when you're in second-and-20 and there's three minutes left, I'm not thinking of running out the clock. I'm thinking about trying to get a first down. We thought that the best way was with a quick pass to Aiyuk, which we did. It got us back in a competitive, at least down where we had a chance on third down, but we didn't get it. That's why we punted to them, thought we could stop them. They went down and got a field goal and then I was very thankful that there was more time on the clock.\"\n\nDid you get any feedback from the league in terms of S Tashaun Gipson's hit or the almost fumble recovery by DL Nick Bosa on those two calls?\n\n\"No, not at all. We will eventually. We always send in stuff we disagree with and they'll tell us whether they agree with our disagreement or not, but regardless of what happens, it really doesn't matter. That's what happened on Sunday and that's what you've got to live with and that's why you got to play better football so it doesn't come down to those calls.\"\n\nWas there a common thread on the two K Jake Moody misses?\n\n\"I didn't think so. I mean, he missed the first one, left and he missed the second one, right. You can ask him about that, but you can get into the technicalities of kicking and everything. But to me it just looked like he missed it a little bit.\"\n\nIt wasn't misreading the wind or anything like that in both cases?\n\n\"No, I mean, I talked to [special teams coordinator Brian Schneider] Schneids on the plane and he didn't mention anything like that. The first one was a tough one. I mean we need to get him in a better situation and have a closer field goal than the first one. I'm glad that we're able to attempt that from that far, but that's not something that if you're real mad at him for always missing that far of one, you're going to be disappointed at times. But the last one was the toughest one, just missed it a little bit there to the right. It was a good experience for him. We'll see how he bounces back from it.\"\n\nWhen the schedule came out, did you did you guys consider staying somewhere toward the middle of the country?\n\n\"Yeah, we did, but since we had the extra day, didn't bother us as much. We're coming back here, we have an eight-day week, which is really unusual in this week. So we didn't feel we needed to do it. We also know how miserable next week's going to be when we have a six-day week coming back from landing at five in the morning on that six-day week. So kind of wanted the guys to be in their own homes this week because we know what it's going to be like here over the next 14 days or so.\"\n\nAfter the game, Trent was talking about the injury he had and how much pain he was in and how he just wanted to kind of just help the team out, keep OL Jaylon Moore out of a difficult situation. Obviously you trust Trent, but how do you kind of balance when this could be putting him at risk or it could be worse for the team to keep a guy like that in and when he is banged up?\n\n\"Oh, that's always the toughest thing because you never want to do something to put someone at a huge jeopardy to make it worse. Well first of all, you've got to ask the trainers, but then you go to the player and you've got to have a history with the player. You've got to kind of know how he is and stuff like that. I truly believe that if Trent couldn't go, Trent's not going to go. He's going to do everything he can to be out there. But Trent's a very intelligent guy who is also very competitive and understands what those decisions are. He said he could come back, I wasn't expecting him because of how bad the injury looked. The trainers thought that it wasn't as serious as it looked. Trent was adamant to get back out there and then we keep our eyes on him all game, which [run game coordinator/offensive line coach] Chris Foerster does a real good job of. So does [assistant offensive line coach James] Cregg and [assistant offensive line coach] Joe [Graves], his assistants. Trent, we thought battled during the game, didn't show any limps. It was a pretty courageous effort by him coming out and those circumstances, especially the player he was going against.\"\n\nHas there been any update on CB Darrell Luter Jr.'s status and how he's progressing?\n\n\"I haven't asked that in this last week. I know he is getting closer. I would guess without me asking, that'd be coming up here in the next few weeks.\"\n\nWhat did you think of LB/DL Randy Gregory on film? He was saying after the game he could have done better in run defense, but obviously he made an impact as a pass rusher. So what were your takeaways in his debut?\n\n\"I thought it was a positive one just getting out there. He has been in our scheme for two and a half practices up to that moment. To be able to get in there and make some plays, get in the sack and the TFL. I loved his length out there. I love what we saw. I think the more he gets with us, the more he practices, the more he understands our scheme, the better he'll get.\"\n\nRB Jordan Mason obviously was part of that final drive. Where is your trust in him if Christian can't play in Minnesota? Would you be okay with Jordan Mason being the top running back in that game?\n\n\"Yeah, we'll see. [RB] Elijah's [Mitchell] earned a ton with us over these years. I think Elijah, when he has been healthy, has been as good of a back as there is. He's just had a hard time staying healthy, but I also can't take away anything from JP. I mean every time JP's got his opportunities, you guys see how he's done. So both of those guys have done very well. Elijah came back and practiced late last week on Thursday. So he got really one true day of practice in and that's why JP got the first nod once Christian came out. But we've got two really good players there. I know [RB Tyrion] TY Davis[-Price] is waiting for his opportunity also. So hopefully Christian will be good to go this week, but if not, we've got a group of backs that we can rely on.\"\n\nYou said for Jake this was a good learning experience, you'll see how he bounces back. Do you feel that really for the whole team that perhaps this was a important game to go through with your aspirations for the rest of the season?\n\n\"Yeah, definitely. I mean, you've got to play good football in this league, or you are going to get beat. It doesn't matter who you play or what or when, but we didn't play that good of football. We almost were still able to pull it out, which I would've been proud of them for doing that. I mean, you're not always going to play great football and you still got to find ways to win. Rarely do the football gods reward you when you make as many mistakes as we did. Not just missed assignments, penalties, missed tackles, a couple missed opportunities that are the difference in winning and losing. When you miss those throughout the game, rarely does it work out in the end. So either way that happened. I think it was a good learning experience and really all that matters is when we come in, when they come in tomorrow and they watch this film with us, just like all that matters when they came in after Dallas and watched the film, is that you watch what you did good, you watch what you did bad, and you make sure that you get better the next week.\"\n\nWhat'd you think of how Aiyuk and WR Jauan Jennings did on that last drive making a couple of those catches to get you down there?\n\n\"It was the best drive of the day. I mean, the first drive of the day was the best one because we ran the ball every play, and then got in at a screen on the last play of that drive. Then the last drive of the game was our second best one on offense. Especially starting it out backed up a little bit, having to make some big plays to get down there. It was Brock's best drive of the game. It was B.A's best drive of the game and Jauan's. I thought our O-Line did a good job in a true passing situation to allow them to have that time. I was happy how they finished that.\"",

        "title": "Nonprofit that flew Americans from Israel to Florida for DeSantis releases new details",
        "body": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- To safely fly Americans from Israel to Tampa on Sunday, Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration partnered with a nonprofit that specializes in bringing U.S. citizens home from conflict zones around the world, covering the cost of air travel that the organization priced out at millions of dollars.\n\nThe Republican governor has said the state is planning more flights in the coming days, but has not said whether the state will continue to partner with Project Dynamo, a Tampa-based organization that has been criticized by U.S. government officials for being too willing to take risks.\n\nProject Dynamo's co-founder, Bryan Stern, told reporters on Monday that his organization had successfully extracted 270 people on Sunday night who had sought to leave Israel as the war with Hamas erupted.\n\nIt was one of five private flights funded by the DeSantis administration through Florida's Division of Emergency Management, Stern said. Of the first four flights, two carried eight people and two carried twelve, transferring fewer passengers because they took off over the Jewish sabbath.\n\n\"This is the first time where any government agency has assisted us financially. The governor of the state of Florida paid for the plane,\" Stern said.\n\nDeSantis' involvement in the foreign policy conflict has amplified the Republican governor's role in what generally would have been outside the state's purview. DeSantis, a presidential candidate, was able to help in the international conflict after issuing an emergency declaration Thursday that gave the executive branch broad powers to spend money and act.\n\nThe average cost of each chartered flight from Israel's Ben Gurion Airport to Tampa International is roughly $2 million, Stern said, based on quotes received by Project Dynamo as it initially planned to charter the planes themselves.\n\nStern noted that insurance costs can vary to fly an airplane into a warzone, and said he did not know how much the state government ultimately paid since it handled the contracts directly.\n\nHe also did not know whether the Florida government would be funding future flights.\n\n\"That's a government question,\" he said, adding that he feared Israel's airspace would soon be closed.\n\nThe governor's office did not respond to questions about the cost of the missions, or whether it plans to fund any additional flights. It has also not explained how the state picked Project Dynamo and has not said whether it required the nonprofit to abide by any rules in exchange for the funding.\n\nDeSantis has direct access to a $500 million \"Emergency Preparedness and Response Fund\" that the Florida Legislature approved last year to give him spending flexibility when he declares emergencies. While it is unclear if the fund was used to pay for the Israel flights, DeSantis has historically tapped into the fund to pay for his priorities, including border security initiatives in Texas.\n\nStern said the nonprofit took the lead on all the logistics.\n\n\"Essentially, we did the ground piece and the manifesting and the case management and all the hard stuff in the war zone,\" Stern said. \"They [the state] funded the aircraft and we landed and got to meet Governor Ron DeSantis.\"\n\nStern said last week that Project Dynamo had been facing logistical barriers as he was on the ground preparing to help Americans leave Israel when his team was put in touch through friends and associates with the Florida administration.\n\nFor example, he said that it was 'extremely difficult\" to get out of Israel. There are plane tickets going for $25,000 a seat in some cases, he said.\n\n\"I think that Gov. DeSantis wanted to do something. But before he issued the executive order, he needed to know that he had partners,\" Stern said on Monday.\n\nStern got in touch with his friend. Republican state Sen. Jay Collins, a veteran from Sarasota, and then had a conversation with officials in Florida's Division of Emergency Management, including its director, Kevin Guthrie.\n\n\"Kevin and I and some others had a kind of in-depth conversation about Dynamo, about us, the idea that we were on the ground, already there, deployed, already had people - everything was basically lined up except for the planes, made us a very good solution that the governor could trust,\" Stern said.\n\n\"Obviously we've done a lot of high-profile media stuff, so it's very easy to do due diligence on us. I think that happened. And about 20 minutes later the executive order came out and we were in business.\"\n\nWhen DeSantis directed the Florida Division of Emergency Management to charter flights for stranded Florida residents, it was not clear how the state planned to fly people from Israel to Florida.\n\nOn Saturday, the governor told Fox News in an interview that Florida was working with the Israeli government to be able to get clearance for the flights to take off.\n\n\"We are an emergency response state, we have a lot of tools at our disposal, we have a lot of relationships, and so this is our Department of Emergency Management leveraging those relationships in a variety of ways. We have contractors, we have relationships with airlines,\" DeSantis said in the interview.\n\nDeSantis did not mention Project Dynamo in the interview.\n\nProject Dynamo's history\n\nProject Dynamo was successful at conducting private rescues of Americans in Afghanistan at the end of the war there in 2021. After the U.S. military departed in September, with Taliban forces in full control, Dynamo chartered an aircraft that flew over 120 U.S. citizens and green card holders to the United States.\n\nThe group, founded by three Florida men, expanded its operations after Afghanistan, rescuing U.S. citizens in Ukraine in 2022 and aiding in the evacuation of Maui in the wake of devastating wildfires there this summer.\n\nBut some in the U.S. government expressed concern that the group took risks that other nonprofits would not. One of their flights out of Afghanistan in September had to be grounded in the United Arab Emirates en route to the United States, after Project Dynamo failed to share the manifest with U.S. authorities in advance. One individual on the flight was ultimately not allowed to enter the United States.\n\nIn an email on Monday, DeSantis spokesperson Jeremy Redfern said that all of the 270 passengers aboard the 17-hour flight from Tel Aviv to Tampa were American citizens. (Stern said passengers included 269 Americans, \"a Czech dude\" and four dogs.)\n\nProject Dynamo can only do one plane at a time, Stern said, thanking DeSantis for being the first American politician ever to greet their evacuees.\n\n\"It just means so much to us. Usually we show up and there is nothing. There is no welcome home, there is nothing,\" Stern said.\n\nOn social media, staffers with DeSantis' presidential campaign reposted mock logos of \"DeSANTIS AIRLINES\" featuring star-spangled eagles and amplified news about the flights to showcase what they believe to be emblematic of DeSantis leadership style.\n\n\"This is what leadership looks like. DeSantis delivers for Americans,\" Christina Pushaw, the rapid response director for DeSantis' presidential campaign posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n----\n\nTampa Bay Times staff Jay Cridlin and C.T.

        "title": "Injuries for RBs Kyren Williams, Ronnie Rivers put damper on Rams' breakthrough ground game",
        "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rams running backs Kyren Williams and Ronnie Rivers are likely to miss games after getting hurt late in Los Angeles' 26-9 victory over the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nSean McVay gave no specifics or prognoses Monday for Williams, who hurt his ankle in the fourth quarter after rushing for a career-high 158 yards, or backup Rivers, who hurt his knee earlier. But the coach indicated he could be without his top two ball-carriers when the Rams (3-3) host Pittsburgh on Sunday.\n\nWilliams and Rivers \"are going to be out for a little bit,\" McVay said. \"It's tough information for both of those guys, who have done a really good job. ... The initial prognosis looks like it's going to be challenging for those guys in the immediate future.\"\n\nThe Rams, who traded away running back Cam Akers last month, could be relying on rookie Zach Evans or practice squad veteran Royce Freeman in their backfield in the immediate future.\n\nThe injuries put a damper on the good feelings from one of the Rams' most impressive ground performances in recent years.\n\nLos Angeles fell behind 9-6 at halftime after the Cardinals' unorthodox defensive fronts fooled McVay and Matthew Stafford into flexing out of some rushing plays. But after running the ball only three times in the first half, the Rams aggressively committed to the run game after halftime with impressive results.\n\nMcVay, ever ready to criticize himself, absorbed a lesson in trusting his plan.\n\n\"We got talked out of some things that we didn't necessarily need to,\" McVay said of the Rams' hesitant play-calling in the first half. \"I knew we had, what was it, three runs in the first half? So, yes, I was aware of that.\"\n\nAlthough McVay has been calling NFL plays for nearly a decade, the Cardinals threw out some unusual schemes that fooled the youngest coach to win a Super Bowl into some regrettable decisions.\n\n\"However you cut it, it's an excuse,\" McVay said. \"I have to do a better job right from the jump for our guys and put them in some better spots.\"\n\nThe Rams' passing game remained solid with strong play from Stafford and another big game from Cooper Kupp, but Los Angeles appeared to have the ingredients for a balanced offense capable of helping out its deliberately undermanned defense. Stafford believes the Rams can excel by establishing their running game whenever possible.\n\n\"It's not as easy as lining up and just running the ball all the time,\" Stafford said. \"The defenses are going to have their hand in it, and we have to do a good job staying on the field on third down, all those kinds of things.\"\n\nWHAT'S WORKING\n\nThe Rams curiously added only one new starter to the offensive line after the unit struggled with injuries and performed poorly overall last season. Yet the line has been significantly better this season, even in the latest injury absence of Joe Noteboom. After this impressive run-blocking effort against the woeful Cardinals, the line deserves credit as a primary reason the Rams are still at .500.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nKupp's return has minimized Tutu Atwell's role in the offense, and that seems unwise. After catching just two balls a week ago against Philadelphia, the speedy third-year pro turned his only target against Arizona into a 30-yard gem of catch-and-run football. The Rams need Atwell's downfield speed to worry opposing defensive coordinators, but he won't threaten them if Stafford never looks his way.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nEdge rusher Byron Young had the best game yet in his promising rookie season with six tackles, five pressures, one sack and two quarterback hits, according to Pro Football Focus. He also forced the fumble that allowed the Rams essentially to wrap up their victory. LA's defense badly misses edge rusher Leonard Floyd, but Young is becoming a factor.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nPuka Nacua is six games into a record-setting start to his career, but the rookie's hands are not perfect. He dropped what would have been a touchdown pass from Stafford in the first half, although the Cards were called for defensive holding on the play. Nacua had more drops than any receiver in the NFL by some measures over the first five weeks, though that's also a product of being targeted more than any receiver.\n\nINJURIES\n\nAlong with two major injuries at running back, NT Kobie Turner came out of his first career start with a shoulder injury, but McVay didn't know how serious it was. Los Angeles is already thin at nose tackle with Bobby Brown sidelined for several more weeks because of a knee injury.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n49 -- The number of games played by the Rams since a running back put up more yards than Williams' 158 against the Cards. The Notre Dame product was slowed by injuries last year, but he seized a starting role this season with two 100-yard games and seven total touchdowns.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nA visit from Pittsburgh (3-2) is a chance to get above .500 against another opponent roughly on the Rams' level. Aaron Donald will get to face his hometown team for only the third time in his career, and he's 0-2 against the Steelers.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

        "title": "Raiders need to correct their problems in the red zone to take advantage of schedule",
        "body": "HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) -- Trip after trip to the red zone Sunday, and the Las Vegas Raiders -- with one exception -- couldn't reach the end zone.\n\nThey still managed to escape with a 21-17 victory over the New England Patriots, but the margin could have been much bigger.\n\nLas Vegas, which visits the Chicago Bears on Sunday, is in a stretch of winnable games, but like against New England, the team could find itself in a position of potentially missing out on victories if Daniel Carlson continues kicking field goals rather than extra points.\n\nThe issues inside the 20-yard line were numerous against the Patriots. Las Vegas hurt itself with untimely penalties, lack of execution and a fluky turnover when Davante Adams was hit hard and the ball popped into the air.\n\n\"Down there, it's all about details and execution,\" coach Josh McDaniels said Monday. \"There's very, very little margin for error. When you make an error, it usually is exacerbated, and it ends up in either a negative play or you're kicking field goals. We fell behind the sticks, I think, three times down there in the red zone, and when you do that, it's very difficult to overcome.\"\n\nThis isn't a new problem. The Raiders are 25th in the NFL in red zone offense at 40.9%, a major reason they are averaging 16.7 points per game, tied with the Cincinnati Bengals for 27th.\n\nUntil this game, Las Vegas had gone six games in a row without reaching 20 points. The Raiders only got there this time because of a sack for a safety in the final moments.\n\nThe lack of red zone production isn't conducive to winning.\n\n\"We have to do better,\" McDaniels said. \"I have to do a better job of trying to get us to play penalty free and be able to capitalize on the opportunities that we have. The good about that is you play good enough to get it down there as many times as you do.\n\n\"I'm a glass half-full guy and we're going to try to fix that, and we're going to do everything we can to do that. I thought we played well on third down enough yesterday to get it down there, and now we've got to capitalize on our opportunities.\"\n\nWHAT'S WORKING\n\nDefensive plays under pressure. On Sunday, Maxx Crosby and Bilal Nichols combined to sack Mac Jones for a safety with 1:47 left to clinch the victory over the Patriots. That came six days after Amik Robertson made a fantastic interception in the end zone to seal the win over the Green Bay Packers with 44 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Raiders defense hasn't been known for making clutch plays, but that side of the ball suddenly has become reliable under pressure.\n\nWHAT NEEDS WORK\n\nThe quarterback play has been lacking. Jimmy Garoppolo hasn't provided the lift the Raiders hoped when they signed him. Brian Hoyer, who played in the second half Sunday in place for the injured Garoppolo, is a veteran who can avoid big mistakes, but isn't someone expected to carry the offense. Rookie Aidan O'Connell had three turnovers in his one start, but is still unproven. The Raiders need to figure out what they have in O'Connell to know whether to go after a QB in next year's draft.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nK Daniel Carlson. He responded to a rare off game to make all four field-goal attempts against the Patriots.\n\nAgainst the Packers, Carlson had a 53-yarder blocked and hit the right upright from 52 yards. But that shows how high the expectations are for one of the league's best kickers.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nWRs Davante Adams and Hunter Renfrow. Adams is one of the league's top receivers, but caught only two passes for 29 yards against New England. Renfrow is two years removed from a 1,000-yard season, but has just six receptions for 59 yards.\n\nINJURIES\n\nGaroppolo's back injury isn't as bad as originally feared, but that doesn't mean he will play. His status is something to watch. S Roderic Teamer injured his hamstring against the Patriots.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n100 -- The percentage of plays Crosby has played defensively the past three games. No other defensive lineman has done that in even one game.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Raiders begin the first of a two-game road trip with a game at the Chicago Bears on Sunday.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

        "title": "No Jefferson means Vikings might have to win ugly. That's just what they did in his 1st absence",
        "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The first game for the Minnesota Vikings without Justin Jefferson was a slog, a glaring reminder of how vital the superstar wide receiver is for their ability to score.\n\nThe Vikings also suggested in Chicago that acumen, grit and pride might be just enough to keep the season alive while Jefferson is sidelined with a hamstring injury -- even if it's going to be ugly at times.\n\n\"We're not going to be picky about finding a way to get a win,\" quarterback Kirk Cousins said.\n\nThe Vikings had 220 yards, their fifth-lowest total in 56 regular season games since Jefferson arrived in 2020. Their 15.4% third-down conversion rate was their fourth-worst in that span, and even after the game the Bears defense still ranks last in the league on third down (50.6%).\n\n\"It was kind of a revolving door of missed assignments here from some of our more reliable players,\" coach Kevin O'Connell said after the 19-13 victory Sunday. \"Our offense will be hungry to go back to work and make sure we rectify some of those things, because honestly the way Kirk was throwing it today, I feel like it could have been a much, much bigger day.\"\n\nThe Bears frequently employed a single high safety rather than the two-deep alignment most common for opponents trying to control Jefferson, daring Jordan Addison, K.J. Osborn and the rest of Minnesota's receivers to beat man-to-man coverage.\n\nAddison did just that midway through the second quarter with the Vikings ahead 6-3, when Cousins zipped a perfectly placed pass up the sideline on the first down, but he slightly mistimed his dive and didn't secure the ball as he landed on the grass.\n\nThe rookie contributed the only offensive touchdown of the afternoon for the Vikings (2-4) two possessions later, his fourth in six games, but the drop was a snapshot of how Jefferson's absence places a greater burden on the rest of the group to outperform their baseline production with the 2022 AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year out for at least another three games.\n\n\"I just need to be more aggressive from the start,\" Addison said. \"What I need to improve on is just attacking the ball, coming back to the ball and just showing people that they can't guard me.\"\n\nWHAT'S WORKING\n\nThe pass rush directed by defensive coordinator Brian Flores -- who blitzed on 22 of 29 dropbacks, per Sportradar -- produced five sacks and eight quarterback hits. Danielle Hunter had two sacks and is tied for the NFL lead with eight. Safety Josh Metellus, playing frequently out of the slot as the nickel back, had a sack, three quarterback hits and a forced fumble.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nAlexander Mattison netted just 44 yards on 18 carries in a regression for the rushing attack after a couple of productive games. The lanes often weren't there between the tackles.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nLinebacker Jordan Hicks had an interception and a fumble recovery for a touchdown to go with a team-leading 10 tackles. He has helped stabilize the defense this season following the departure of mainstay Eric Kendricks.\n\n\"He was not going to be denied a chance to be the guy to go out there and respond,\" O'Connell said.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nFullback C.J. Ham is one of the most respected players on the team, but his presence as a blocker hasn't done much for the lagging ground game. He also contributed to an intentional grounding call on Cousins in the fourth quarter when he stayed with the rusher instead of turning to try to catch a screen pass.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nOLB Marcus Davenport, who missed most or all of three games with an injury to his right ankle, hurt the other one in the second quarter against the Bears and didn't return. O'Connell indicated his absence might be longer term. ... LG Ezra Cleveland hurt his foot and was replaced by Dalton Risner. His status is day to day, O'Connell said on Monday.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n26:15 -- The average time of possession per game for the Vikings this season. That's the lowest in the league and also the lowest for the team since at least 1991, according to available data from Sportradar.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Vikings host San Francisco on Monday night, with the 49ers coming off their first loss of the season in a concerning game at Cleveland during which three vital offensive players -- running back Christian McCaffrey, wide receiver Deebo Samuel and left tackle Trent Williams -- suffered injuries that make their availability this week unclear.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

Department of Transportation (RIDOT).\n\nThere have been 63 traffic fatalities so far this year, which is in stark contrast to the 39 reported around the same time last year.\n\n\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" RIDOT wrote in a social media post. \"Drive as if your life depends on it.\"\n\nAAA Northeast's Mark Schieldrop said the uptick is a cause for concern.\n\n\"It seems like there is a constant drumbeat of horrific crashes [in Rhode Island],\" Schieldrop said. \"It's very troubling ... but it's honestly not that surprising.\"\n\nSchieldrop said there has been an uptick in \"bad driving behaviors\" across the board, such as speeding, aggressive driving, impaired driving and distracted driving.\n\n\"These are all [behaviors] that are potentially going to cost them their lives,\" Schieldrop explained. \"It seems that folks aren't getting the message, or maybe they don't care.\"\n\n\"You have to wonder why people are choosing to put themselves and others at risk,\" he continued.\n\nThough these bad driving behaviors typically overlap, Schieldrop emphasized that people are driving \"way too fast.\"\n\nInvestigators believe \"extreme speed\" was a factor in the crash that killed a young man and woman in Burrillville over the weekend.\n\nSchieldrop believes driving is \"one of the most risky things we do\" every single day.\n\n\"I don't think that we take that seriously enough,\" he said. \"We lose sight of the fact we are traveling at a high rate of speed in a big hunk of metal and that can cause tremendous damage if something goes wrong.\"\n\nThough the increase in traffic fatalities is concerning, Schieldrop hopes it will serve as a wake-up call and push drivers to rethink their own behavior behind the wheel.\n\n\"To get these numbers down, it starts at home with our own driving behavior,\" Schieldrop said. \"When you get in the car, take a deep breath and say, 'I'm not going to lose my cool behind the wheel today.'

        "body": "Beijing: China's local authorities are finding it more expensive to sell bonds, the latest sign of rising stress as policymakers ramp up borrowings to stimulate growth and defuse short-term payment risks.\n\nOf the local government yuan bonds sold so far this year, 50 carry coupons with a premium of more than 25 basis points with comparable sovereign debt, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That's the most since 2020.\n\nThe jump is a departure from the success enjoyed by these borrowers in the past two years, when they had priced almost every note with a yield spread of less than 25 basis points, the lower end of an unofficial band set by regulators. The higher coupons come as local authorities grapple with dwindling land sales and taxation, as a housing-led economic slump persists.\n\nIf the demand indigestion worsens, it will heap pressure on the People's Bank of China (PBoC) to step up liquidity support or ease monetary policy further to fund Beijing's stimulus plans.\n\n\"Banks are already well fed after absorbing a large amount of local government bonds,\" said Liu Lin, deputy general manager of investment banking at Bank of China Ltd. \"Pricing may need to better reflect the market dynamics in the fourth quarter.\"\n\nChinese banks owned 83% of the debt at the end of August, the lowest proportion based on Bloomberg-compiled data going back to 2019.\n\nA surge in the debt sales and signs of economic stabilisation - raising fears of less easing - have hurt the world's second-largest bond market in recent months, pushing benchmark sovereign yields to a fourth-month high at one point.\n\nThe splurge comes because local authorities had used up over 90% of their special bond quotas for 2023 in the first three quarters, Bloomberg-compiled data show, while sales by the central government also picked up in September.\n\nMore supply is arriving, including a 1 trillion yuan programme to help regional governments refinance hidden debts - a risk that Beijing is keen to reduce.\n\nPolicymakers are also weighing additional sovereign bond sales of at least 1 trillion yuan for spending on infrastructure, Bloomberg News reported on Oct 11.\n\nLocal authorities traditionally exert strong influence on guiding banks to bid at lower yields, said Yang Hao, a fixed-income analyst at Nanjing Securities Co. However, when sentiment weakens, \"the low yields become harder to sustain\", he said, adding that demand looks weaker for long-dated notes from fiscally vulnerable regions.\n\nProvinces such as Hunan, Jilin, Jiangxi and Anhui are among those paying higher coupons this year, Bloomberg-compiled data show.\n\nTo be sure, the chances of defaults by local governments remain slim, even for those with strained finances, said Ding Shuang, chief economist for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Plc.\n\n\"If local debt yields deviate too much from those of sovereigns, we would expect some intervention or guidance from the government to correct it.\"\n\nThe nation's central bank may also be called upon to do more.\n\nThe prospect of increased government bond supply means \"the PBoC may need to step up its liquidity support and lower interest rates to accommodate the issuance, which adds conviction to our call for another cut to required rate of return and a policy rate cut in the fourth quarter,\"\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc analysts including Maggie Wei and Hui Shan wrote in a note, referring to banks' reserve requirement ratio. -- Bloomberg",

        "body": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- President Joe Biden will travel to Israel and on to Jordan Wednesday to meet with both Israeli and Arab leadership, as concerns increase that the raging Israel-Hamas war could expand into a larger regional conflict.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Biden's travel to Israel as the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip grows more dire and as Israel prepares for a possible ground attack on the 141-square-mile (365-square-kilometer) territory to root out Hamas militants responsible for what U.S. and Israeli officials say was the most lethal assault against Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nBiden is looking to send the strongest message yet that the U.S. is behind Israel. His Democratic administration has pledged military support, sending U.S. carriers and aid to the region. Officials have said they would ask Congress for upward of $2 billion in additional aid for both Israel and Ukraine, which is fighting Russia's invasion.\n\nBlinken made the announcement early Tuesday after more than seven hours of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials.\n\n\"He is coming here at a critical moment for Israel, for the region and for the world,\" Blinken said.\n\nShortly after in Washington, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby announced that Biden would also go to Jordan to meet with King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\n\"We've been crystal clear about the need for humanitarian aid to be able to continue to flow into Gaza,\" Kirby said. \"That has been a consistent call by President Biden and certainly by this entire administration.\"\n\nTruckloads of aid idled Monday at Egypt's border with Gaza, barred from entry, as residents and humanitarian groups pleaded for water, food and fuel for dying generators, saying the tiny Palestinian territory sealed off by Israel after last week's rampage by Hamas was near total collapse.\n\nBiden had been scheduled to travel to Pueblo, Colorado, on Monday but decided to postpone the visit so he could consult with his aides and speak with fellow leaders about the unfolding situation in the Middle East.\n\nThe announcements came after Biden consulted with a trio of world leaders and his own national security team on Monday amid growing global concern about the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the Gaza Strip and fears that the Israel-Hamas war could metastasize into a broader regional conflict.\n\nBiden spoke by phone with Egypt's el-Sissi, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz about the fallout from Hamas militants' surprise attacks on Israel that left 1,400 dead and retaliatory strikes that have killed at least 2,778 Palestinians.\n\nEuropean Union leaders will hold an emergency summit on Tuesday as concern mounts that the war between Israel and Hamas could fuel tensions in Europe and bring more refugees in search of sanctuary.\n\nBiden's call with the Egyptian leader came one day after el-Sissi met with Blinken in Cairo. Egypt's state-run media said el-Sissi told Blinken that Israel's Gaza operation has exceeded \"the right of self-defense\" and turned into \"a collective punishment.\"\n\nKirby declined to comment on el-Sissi's concerns about how Israel is conducting the war.\n\n\"The humanitarian situation was high on the list of the discussion with President el-Sissi,\" Kirby said.\n\nEarlier Monday, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed in the Oval Office by their national security team on the situation on the ground in Israel and Gaza. White House chief of staff Jeff Zients joined the briefing led by national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and Central Intelligence Agency Director Bill Burns, according to the White House.\n\nBlinken was in Israel on Monday for his second visit in less than a week for talks with Israeli leaders. He has been crisscrossing the Middle East with stops in Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBlinken, in talks Monday with Netanyahu and other Israeli officials, carried back some of the feedback he received from Arab leaders. He also \"underlined his firm support for Israel's right to defend itself from Hamas' terrorism and reaffirmed U.S. determination to provide the Israeli government with what it needs to protect its citizens,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.\n\n--\n\nLong and Madhani reported from Washington.

        "body": "This aerial photo shows a cargo ship at a smart container terminal of Tianjin Port in North China's Tianjin, July 7, 2023. [Photo/Xinhua]\n\nFormer vice-president of World Bank says China will not decline like Japan\n\nChina will not follow in Japan's footsteps of the 1990s and fall into a so-called balance-sheet recession period characterized by income being used to pay down debt rather than spend, according to a top economist.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with China Daily, Justin Yifu Lin, dean of the Institute of New Structural Economics at Peking University, said despite facing some difficulties including housing-related debt issues, the Chinese economy, with endogenous strength from factors like its enormous domestic market and increasing innovation capability, is well poised to rebound and experience \"dynamic\" growth and make a great contribution to global economic development.\n\n\"When income does not grow and debt is very high, debt payments will become a burden forcing households and enterprises to reduce investment and consumption in order to repay loans, leading to sluggish economic growth,\" said Lin, a former senior vice-president and chief economist at the World Bank.\n\nChina's debt level is not that high compared with many others in the world, and more importantly, Chinese people's income is still on the rise thanks to emerging industries and industrial upgrades, he said.\n\n\"The key issue is whether we will be able to continue to have dynamic growth. In the case of Japan, after the Plaza Accord, they voluntarily or involuntarily gave up the semiconductor industry, and we didn't see any new industry emerge in Japan,\" Lin said.\n\n\"I'm sure China will continue to have technological innovation and industrial upgrading to raise the productivity, and with that, the incomes of households and profits of companies will increase,\" he added.\n\nRecent economic data has indicated that the economic recovery in China is gathering pace.\n\nFresh data from the People's Bank of China, the central bank, showed that the aggregate social financing, or the total amount of financing to the real economy, reached 4.12 trillion yuan ($560 billion) in September, up by 563 billion yuan from a year earlier and 1 trillion yuan from August, respectively, pointing to a picking up of financing activity.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, China's official manufacturing and nonmanufacturing purchasing managers indexes both improved in September to 50.2 and 51.7, respectively. The figures were both above the 50-point mark separating contraction from expansion.\n\nLin believes the current difficulties facing the Chinese economy are mainly rooted in the external environment. Sluggish global economic growth subdues demand for Chinese products, affecting domestic investment and consumption, he said.\n\nHe suggested Chinese authorities expand the fiscal deficit and ease monetary policy to boost investment, consumption and job creation, and enhance confidence.\n\nThe economist added that despite the attempts of Western countries, the United States in particular, to weaken China's position in global industrial and supply chains through trade restrictions, China has reached a stage that \"as long as we think it's necessary, we will be able to mobilize enough resources and talent to get breakthroughs in those areas (facing Western countries' trade restrictions)\".\n\n\"Huawei is a very good example. Huawei cannot import those chips from US companies, but as you see, Huawei has already got breakthroughs. I think the story that applies to Huawei will also be applicable to other sectors in China,\" Lin said.\n\nTrade is win-win for any country, he said, adding the best way for China to address trade restrictions and curtailment attempts from the US and others is to maintain stability, growth and openness, through pursuing technological innovation and industrial upgrading to expand the domestic market while at the same time further opening up to the rest of the world.\n\n\"We have every intention to maintain peace and stability in the world, and we also want to contribute to the stability and growth in the world,\" he said.\n\n\"As long as we do our things right, and maintain our stability and growth, I think by opening up our economy to the world, we'll be friends to everyone in the world.\"",

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- US pharmacy chain Rite Aid Corp. is moving quickly to sell its assets in bankruptcy, over the objection of at least one potential bidder, because the company faces looming financial deadlines, a company lawyer said during the chain's first day under court supervision.\n\nThe lenders who are financing the company's reorganization have imposed near-term deadlines as a condition for loaning Rite Aid money, Ross J. Fiedler told the judge overseeing the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nOne potential bidder is a \"household name\" that needs more time to put together an offer, restructuring attorney Andrew Dietderich said during the hearing in Trenton, New Jersey. Imposing a deadline of Nov. 16 on his client and others \"frankly is ridiculous,\" Dietderich said.\n\nRite Aid has agreed to sell its pharmacy benefit manager business, which acts as a middleman between insurers and patients, for $575 million. MedImpact Healthcare Systems has agreed to be the initial bidder for the business, called Elixir, in exchange for a potential breakup fee worth 3.5% of the purchase price.\n\nRite Aid got unusually quick approval for the bidding rules and the breakup fee from US Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan. To save more than 45,000 jobs and avoid disrupting the flow of medicines to millions of customers, the company needs to quickly reorganize under court protection, Rite Aid's lead attorney Josh Sussberg said in court Monday.\n\nRite Aid closed hundreds of stores before filing bankruptcy and will use its time in Chapter 11 to shutter other locations that are under-performing, Sussberg said. Major retailers like Rite Aid often turn to bankruptcy because Chapter 11 allows troubled companies to get-out of expensive leases at relatively little cost.\n\nThe company's need to reduce its locations reflects the way the pharmacy business has changed over the last two decades. Rite Aid is not just facing stiffer competition from national chains like CVS and Walgreens, but increasingly from big box retailers like Walmart Inc. and Target Corp., grocery stores like Kroger Co. and even Amazon.com Inc., Sussberg said.\n\n\"To say the competitive dynamic in this industry has changed significantly since the 80s and 90s, when Rite Aid was the number one chain in the country, would be an understatement,\" Sussberg said.\n\nRite Aid undertook a series of debt swaps and pay downs between 2020 and 2022 in an attempt to cut its interest expenses, according to court papers. It pays about $200 million annually in interest, Sussberg said.\n\nRite Aid has also been battling opioid claims, and faces about 1,400 lawsuits, mostly from governmental entities that blame the company for contributing to an epidemic of addiction to pain killers.\n\nThe case is Rite Aid Corp., 23-18993, US Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey.",

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.'s Tim Cook showed up at a Tencent gaming tournament in China, an endorsement for one of the biggest earners on the app store as uncertainty persists about the US company's top overseas market.\n\nThe chief executive officer waved and made brief remarks to shoppers and staff during a surprise visit to Apple's Taikoo Li store in the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu, according to a brief video posted on the social media platform Weibo. Cook thanked gamers who were vying for the top prize in Honor of Kings, Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s longest-running cash cow.\n\n\"The energy tonight was off the charts!\" Cook wrote in a brief post in English and Chinese. It included video of fans playing the game, which was developed by Tencent's TiMi studio.\n\nCook's personal outing underscores the country's importance to Apple, its biggest international market and the cornerstone of its manufacturing network. He's also showing up at a time the US is ramping up sanctions to contain China's semiconductor ambitions.\n\nRead More: Apple's IPhones Off to Sluggish Start in China, Study Shows\n\nThe CEO turned up in Chengdu hours after a pair of research studies pointed to a disappointing start to sales in China for the iPhone 15, the latest version of a marquee device that underpins the majority of Apple's global revenue. Sales of the flagship gadget were down 4.5% versus the iPhone 14 over their first 17 days after release, Counterpoint Research estimated in previously unreported figures provided to Bloomberg News.\n\nCook's itinerary is unclear. Global executives and heads of state are slated to convene in Beijing this week for the annual Belt and Road forum, a signature initiative of Xi Jinping's that is regarded as key to the Chinese economy and diplomacy.\n\nBeijing has pledged this year to support private and foreign businesses, though criticism remains about the opacity of regulations. The iPhone's 15 debut came weeks after the launch of Huawei Technologies Co.'s Mate 60 Pro, celebrated as a triumph over US sanctions because of its advanced made-in-China processor.\n\nIt also coincided with a government mandate to expand a ban on iPhone use to official agencies and state companies, underscoring Apple's growing challenges there.\n\nCook has continued to tout the strength of Apple's China relationship. During a trip to the country this year, he called the partnership \"symbiotic.\" Back in March, Cook also paid at visit to the Shanghai headquarters of Genshin Impact creator Mihoyo, another key source of gaming revenue for Apple's app store.\n\nRead More: US to Tighten Rules Aimed at Keeping Advanced Chips Out of China",

        "title": "What's On the Table for Venezuela's Deal With the Opposition - BNN Bloomberg",
        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Venezuelan officials are expected to announce a preliminary agreement Tuesday that could open the door for sanctions relief in exchange for basic electoral guarantees.\n\nAfter months of roadblocks, representatives for President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government and the US-backed opposition will sign a deal in Barbados on Tuesday. Any significant concessions from Maduro, such as allowing banned opposition candidates to run in the 2024 presidential vote, could lead the US to ease crippling restrictions on Venezuela's oil industry.\n\n1. What should we expect tomorrow?\n\nProbably a broad agreement without concrete details between top Maduro officials and opposition members belonging to the Unitary Platform. The terms will likely lead to more specific agreements once negotiations advance, and any move on the US-side will depend on concrete moves from the Maduro government.\n\n2. What's the opposition asking for?\n\nThe opposition has been asking for fairer electoral conditions, which other than allowing all willing candidates to participate, also include concessions such as setting a definitive date for the vote.\n\nEqual coverage in Venezuela's highly censored media landscape is also among their requests, as well as inviting observers from at least five international organizations, especially the European Union, Carter Center and United Nations.\n\n3. What could Maduro obtain in return?\n\nThe US could offer Maduro much needed relief on oil sanctions, which have prevented oil exports to the US -- formerly its biggest buyer -- since 2019. The limits have also prevented European and Asian oil majors from engaging with Venezuela so as not breach sanctions and thus be subject to significant penalties.\n\nAn expanded license could allow U.S. oil giant Chevron Corp. to boost oil production and other major foreign firms, such as Italy's Eni Spa, Spain's Repsol SA, France's Maurel & Prom SA and China's China National Petroleum Corp., to jump-start production.\n\nLifting sanctions against Venezuela's state banks, such as Bandes and Venezuela's central bank, could allow Maduro to retrieve at least $3 billion from overseas accounts.\n\n4. Why now?\n\nVenezuela is expected to hold primary elections on Sunday, where conservative candidate Mar\u00eda Corina Machado is widely expected to win with about 86% of support from those highly likely to cast their ballots. Machado is banned from holding public office -- alongside several other opposition leaders -- and her potential victory would add significant pressure to Maduro to allow for her to participate.\n\nOn that note, Maduro is likely run for a third presidential term next year, and the easing of sanctions would allow him and his administration access to much-needed funds to rally support ahead of the vote.\n\nVenezuela also stands to lose its most important foreign asset as the sale of state-owned Citgo Petroleum's parent company is scheduled to start next week, with more than 20 creditors seeking to satisfy around $23 billion of claims against the country.",

        "title": "Ambani's Youngest Son, Anant, Faces Proxy Firms' Pushback on Board Seat -  BNN Bloomberg",
        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., an international proxy advisory firm, has recommended that shareholders vote against the proposal to appoint billionaire Mukesh Ambani's youngest son, Anant Ambani, on the board of the family-controlled Reliance Industries Ltd., underscoring concerns around succession planning at India's largest company by market value.\n\n\"A vote against this resolution is warranted as Anant Ambani's limited leadership/board experience of around six years, raises concerns on his potential contribution to the board,\" ISS said in an Oct. 12 note, which it shared with Bloomberg. It has backed the board appointments of his elder siblings, Isha and Akash Ambani, in the shareholder vote that will close on Oct. 26.\n\nISS's objections echo the recommendations from Mumbai-based Institutional Investor Advisory Services, or IIAS, which said in an Oct. 9 report, that \"at 28 years of age,\" appointment of the young Ambani scion \"does not align with our voting guidelines.\" IIAS has supported the proposals seeking to elect Isha and Akash.\n\nReliance did not respond to Bloomberg's queries but told the proxy companies that Anant has \"the relevant experience and maturity to add value to the board deliberations\" given his participation in the conglomerate's businesses and the grooming he has received from senior leadership over the years. Both ISS and IIAS added Reliance's response to their reports.\n\nAnother international proxy firm, Glass Lewis, is in favor of Anant's appointment. \"We do not single out Anant Ambani from the other siblings based on experience,\" Decky Windarto, Glass Lewis's director of Asia-Pacific Research, said in an emailed response. \"We noted that the other two directors up for election are just three years older than Anant, with similar professional experiences.\"\n\nWhile the induction of Anant and his elder, twin siblings as non-executive, non-independent directors, is critical to the succession plan announced by Asia's richest person, the counterpoints from proxy advisories show that Ambani and the \"next-generation\" leaders at $190 billion group will continue to be in focus for corporate governance watchers.\n\nEvolving Expectations\n\nThe recommendations from ISS and IIAS also point to the evolving investor expectations from a conglomerate that now counts Google and Meta Platforms Inc. among marquee investors in its consumer businesses.\n\nReliance's founders own over 41% shares in the company, making them the single largest voting chunk. The three resolutions need a majority of votes cast to go through. Foreign and local institutions, that often vote based on proxy firms' recommendations, own close to 40% in Reliance. Their stance will be known after the voting closes.\n\nSuccession is a crucial issue for the billionaire. Ambani, who was appointed to the Reliance board in 1977 at the age of 20, had to tackle a bitter fraternal feud after his father died without a will in 2002.\n\nFrom Reliance investors' viewpoint, the leadership transition is critical as the fossil fuel behemoth transforms into a consumer and technology titan with massive green energy ambitions. Ambani told shareholders in August he intends to helm the company for five years as he prepares his children.\n\nAkash, 31, has been working at Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. since 2014 and is currently its chairman, said the company notice to shareholders. Isha, also 31, has been driving the expansion of the retail business as an executive director of Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. Both have presented to shareholders at the flagship's annual shareholder meeting in the past few years.\n\nAnant, said to be driving the expansion of energy and materials businesses, especially green energy, has yet to formally address shareholders. Anant has been a member of Reliance's executive committee, is on the boards of two green energy subsidiaries and \"has been part of the decision making for the large strategic investments and partnerships,\" according to the company response included in the ISS report.",

        "body": "The Chief Executive Officer of one of the most blooming footwear brands in Ghana, Royal Diadem Footwear Garage, Benjamin Asiam-Amanfo, has revealed that in the course of his practice as a pharmacy assistant, he discovered a new, insurmountable passion for shoe-making.\n\nIn an interview on Joy Learning TV's entrepreneurship development programme dubbed, 'The Career Trail', he disclosed that, the fervor began when his former boss used to make shoes for him to wear to work and church.\n\nIn addition, he loved to look nice and do things for himself hence, he approached his former boss and requested to work with him after quitting his job as an pharmacy assistant.\n\n\"He was getting me shoes to wear and actually, I love to do things for myself, so along the line, I told him I wanted to work with him. In the beginning, it was a business aspect, he made it for me then I sold it. Later, I told him I wanted to learn and do it myself. That's how come it started,\" he explained.\n\nStarting a business was not a simple process for Benjamin, and like any other businessman, he faced hurdles when he quit his job as a pharmacy assistant to pursue shoe-making.\n\nHe mentioned a number of difficulties, including his parents cutting off the power to his 'kiosk,' where he began his business.\n\nAccording to him, this contention went on for about three months but he persisted until his business came to light. He added that this was made possible when Joy Business Van, a business programme on JoyNews captured his story and through that, his parents embraced his new profession.\n\nAs a shoe-maker, Benjamin was at the receiving end of much ridicule and belittling, but he was focused and determined though he admits it hasn't been easy.\n\n\"The only thing I really haven't liked about it is someone looking down on me because the person feels you're into shoe-making. One thing about me is I hate to disrespect people hence if I'm being disrespected it worries me,\" he lamented.\n\nNonetheless, by dint of hard work and determination, Mr. Asiam-Amanfo affirmed that, through shoe-making, he has met very prominent people including Abeiku Santa, Jerry Justice, Nana Romeo, Fada Dickson, among others, an opportunity that pharmacy could not offer.\n\nHe emphatically stated that he has never regretted starting Royal Diadem Footwear Garage despite the mockery he still faces because some people still look down on the profession.\n\n\"I would choose shoe-making over pharmacy because it's flexible and comfortable,\" he noted.\n\nHe advised aspiring entrepreneurs that \"There's time for everything and patience is key.\"\n\nBenjamin Asiam-Amanfo practiced pharmacy for three years and holds a degree in Pharmacy.\n\nAlthough he may have quit his job as a pharmacy assistant, he still has aspirations of establishing a pharmaceutical shop in the near future.",

Breaking News | Local Sports | Daily Headlines | Local Obituaries | Weather | Local Offers Click to Sign up!\n\nAttendees were treated to more than food and wine at the event, enjoying Vega Vineyard's farm stand and mini-petting zoo, a specialty relaxation station on-site for those desiring some respite, the Bank of Marin Bubble Lounge, a temporary women's boutique, culinary demonstrations and live music by Generic Clapton.\n\n\"There was so much to do,\" Laslett said.\n\nThe layout of food and wine stations was reconfigured this year, tucked into \"nooks and crannies\" on the vineyard's farm grounds where attendees were surprised with \"a sense of delight\" around every corner, Laslett said.\n\n\"There were really wonderful spots to tuck people into,\" she added, referring to the intimate layout which was said to require a greater level of preparation to maximize festivalgoer experience.\n\n\"My favorite comment of the day was from Richard Sampson who said, 'This is brave, Alison.'\"\n\nConsidered somewhat of a gamble, having completely altered the schematics of the association's widely-attended annual event -- Laslett deems it a win.\n\n\"We kind of won the gamble,\" she said. \"It felt great. It was such a success.\"",

        "body": "SINGAPORE, Oct. 17, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Berge Bulk, one the world's leading dry bulk ship owners, launches its Newcastlemax bulker, Berge Olympus, with four retrofitted BARTech WindWings by Yara Marine Technologies. The WindWings installation is part of Berge Bulk's ambition to become carbon neutral by 2025 and marks the Berge Olympus as the world's most powerful sailing cargo ship.\n\nWith four WindWings installed, each possessing an aerodynamic span of 37.5 metres height and 20 metres width, the Berge Olympus will save 6 tonnes of fuel per day on an average worldwide route and, in the process, reduce CO emissions by approximately 19.5 tonnes per day. With these fuel savings and CO reductions, Berge Bulk is evaluating the potential of installing WindWings on more of its vessels that trade on routes with favourable wind conditions.\n\nBerge Bulk's WindWings project is a testament to its commitment to lead the way towards a zero-carbon future while enhancing vessel efficiency. This initiative aligns with the new IMO goals, to reach net-zero GHG emissions from international shipping by or around, i.e., close to 2050, as well as indicative check-points for international shipping to reach net-zero GHG emissions for 2030 (by at least 20%, striving for 30%) and 2040 (by at least 70%, striving for 80%). Contributing to this mission, Berge Bulk's WindWings project reflects its dedication to environmental sustainability and technological advancement.\n\nIn addition to the installation of the WindWings, Berge Olympus has been retrofitted with a shaft generator system. The shaft generator is driven by the main engine to supply electric power to the vessel, thus saving fuel and reducing emissions. With a 1MW capacity, it is sized to eliminate the need to operate auxiliary engines while at sea. This installation is in itself ground-breaking and concludes a program that saw multiple vessels retrofitted with the technology.\n\nAs part of the global effort to reach future decarbonisation goals, Berge Bulk is forging a trail to carbon neutrality by 2025 through safe, efficient and sustainable shipping. To achieve this milestone, Berge Bulk has deployed a four-pillar decarbonisation plan that focuses on improving fleet efficiency, leveraging the latest maritime technology, piloting new fuels and investing in carbon capture, Berge Bulk calls it the Marshall Plan. Berge Bulk's adoption of WindWings - the culmination of years of research by naval architect BAR Technologies - highlights the clear opportunity for vessel owners to swiftly retrofit new technologies to make a rapid and profound difference to the climate impact of their fleet.\n\nJames Marshall, Chief Executive Officer, Berge Bulk concluded: \"At Berge Bulk, we are constantly striving to enhance our efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of our existing fleet. From 2008 until today, we have achieved a remarkable 46% reduction in our CO emissions per tonne mile, already surpassing the 2030 IMO target for reducing carbon emissions intensity. There's still so much to do as we accelerate the transition to new fuel in the zero-carbon future. That is why we are proud to partner with BAR Technologies and Yara Marine Technologies to pioneer this WindWing system. The Berge Olympus is a testament to innovation and sustainability.\"\n\nJohn Cooper, Chief Executive Officer, BAR Technologies said: \"We're immensely proud to be spearheading wind-assisted propulsion through the development of WindWings and through our shared vision with Berge Bulk to launch the world's most powerful sailing cargo ship. We cannot afford to stand still in developing sustainable solutions for the shipping industry. We believe there is more to be done to harness wind power and push shipping into a greener, and more efficient era. To that end, we are already working on superior hydrodynamics and new types of accommodation blocks with several vessel designers.\"\n\nThomas Koniordos, Chief Executive Officer, Yara Marine Technologies said: \"Wind-assisted propulsion has the potential to offer immediate long-term solutions for shipping's pathway to Net Zero. We are proud to work with trusted partners such as Berge Bulk and ensure that this technology can be scaled and manufactured to shipping's high standards, ensuring a robust and resilient supply chain that can meet industry demand.\"\n\nBerge Bulk is one of the world's leading independent dry bulk owners and has an outstanding record for its reliable, safe and efficient delivery of commodities around the world. Starting out with 12 vessels in 2007, the company now owns, operates and manages a fleet of 85 safe and fuel-efficient vessels, equating to 14 million DWT.\n\nBerge Bulk's vision is to lead the world to a zero-carbon future through safe, efficient and sustainable shipping. Acknowledging the crucial role of emerging marine technologies in this transformation, Berge Bulk takes an active stance by retrofitting its existing vessels with revolutionary decarbonisation equipment as part of pilot trials, expediting the progress towards greener maritime practices.\n\nWith an impressive heritage, having originally spun out from the former British, America's Cup Team, BAR Tech provides a wide range of design and engineering consultancy services with a focus on 4 key sectors; Workboats and Commercial Vessels, Shipping, Special Projects and Leisure Marine and Yachts.\n\nBAR Technologies offer a cohesive team of world lead naval architects and optimisation specialists; fluid dynamists; mechanical, structural and composite engineers; control strategy and system specialists; they offer data and simulation engineers with access to the latest commercial knowledge, using bespoke in-house design tools.\n\nYara Marine (YMT) provides technologies to enable a greener maritime industry.\n\nSince 2010, YMT has been at the forefront of maritime emissions reduction, working closely with ship-owners, yards, and naval architects as partners in our effort to drive the change towards sustainable shipping. Today, Yara Marine offers a portfolio of green technologies, such as SOx scrubbers, fuel optimization systems - FuelOpt and Fleet Analytics, turnkey shore power solutions, and the cutting-edge, advanced wind-assisted propulsion system WindWings.",

        "title": "Wake-up call: Kyle Shanahan discusses this positive from 49ers' loss to Browns",
        "body": "Richard Sherman saw a silver lining in the San Francisco 49ers' loss to the Cleveland Browns. The former NFL cornerback went as far as to suggest that it might be a blessing in disguise.\n\n\"Sometimes, you need a wake-up call,\" Sherman said on his podcast. \"You don't want to go undefeated and get the wake-up call in the playoffs because it's over. This team is going to learn from this.\"\n\nThis defeat, the 49ers' first of the season, served as a crucial learning experience, especially for a team with Super Bowl aspirations. Was it an important experience to undergo?\n\n\"Yeah, definitely,\" Shanahan responded during a Monday afternoon conference call. \"I mean, I think you've got to play good football in this league or you're going to get beat. And it doesn't matter who you play or win, but we didn't play that good of football, and we almost were still able to pull it out, which I would have been proud of them for doing that.\n\n\"I mean, you're not always going to play great football, and you've still got to find ways to win. But rarely do the football gods reward you when you make as many mistakes as we did. Not just missed assignments, penalties, missed tackles, a couple of missed opportunities that are the difference in winning and losing. And when you miss those throughout the game, it really doesn't work out in the end.\"\n\nAside from solid opening and closing efforts, the 49ers offense struggled to assemble complete drives throughout the game. The team committed a season-high 12 penalties for a whopping 105 yards. Rookie kicker Jake Moody missed on two field goals, including the potential game-winner. Quarterback Brock Purdy turned in his worst performance since becoming a starter, evident by his 55.3 passer rating.\n\nYes, there were key injuries, but that's no excuse in the team's eyes. They have to learn to overcome adversity. Sunday's game offered valuable learning opportunities for the 49ers, potentially strengthening their performance down the stretch.\n\n\"So either way that happened, I think it was a good learning experience,\" Shanahan continued. \"And really, all that matters is, when they come in tomorrow, and they watch this film with us, just like all that matters when they came in after Dallas and watched the film, is that you watch what you did good, you watch what you did bad, and you make sure that you get better the next week.\"",

        "title": "Geno Smith carried the blame but there were plenty of factors in why the Seahawks faltered",
        "body": "RENTON, Wash. (AP) -- If something doesn't go right, Seattle quarterback Geno Smith is usually quick to take the blame -- even if he's not completely at fault.\n\nThat was the case again Sunday after the Seahawks' frustrating 17-13 loss at Cincinnati where Smith had far from his best game.\n\nDespite throwing for 323 yards, Smith tossed two interceptions, missed a couple of big play opportunities and at times appeared hesitant to throw. He also took a costly sack in the fourth quarter that turned first-and-goal at the Cincinnati 7 into second-and-goal at the 19, one of four trips to the red zone where Seattle failed to come away with points and ultimately proved the difference.\n\n\"I felt like the guys deserved to win today. Obviously, I didn't do my best job today to get that done,\" Smith said. \"So those are things I put on myself, I lay right on my feet right, on my shoulders and I look forward to the next opportunity.\"\n\nSmith needed to be better in some critical moments, but he didn't need to shoulder all the blame for this loss. Seattle's makeshift offensive line finally showed leaks after somehow holding together the past few weeks with several starters out. One of Smith's interceptions was a miscommunication with DK Metcalf. And Seattle's play calling could have put Smith in a better position for some of those red zone trips that came up empty.\n\n\"We had so many ways to win in that football game and so many ways to score and opportunities that got squandered,\" Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. \"But there was just a lot of positives moving forward.\"\n\nWHAT'S WORKING\n\nSeattle defensive coordinator Clint Hurtt deserves recognition for the adjustments made in the second half that stifled Cincinnati's offense. The Bengals were held to three points, 52 total yards and four first downs in the second half by Seattle. The three points came after a turnover and a drive during which Cincinnati gained zero yards.\n\nCincinnati finished with 214 total yards, the second straight opponent Seattle has held under 250 yards of offense. The last time Seattle did that was Weeks 16 and 17 in 2015.\n\nThe focus this offseason was on improving the run defense and Seattle certainly has done that. The Bengals rushed for 46 yards and averaged 3.1 yards per rush. But the overall performance has to be an encouraging sign moving forward.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe offensive line was a mess in the second half and led to some of the problems Smith faced. Smith had been hit a total of 12 times during Seattle's three-game win streak. He was hit 13 times by the Bengals. The protection just wasn't there the way it needed to be, even with the return of left tackle Charles Cross after missing the previous three games with a toe injury.\n\nGetting guard Damien Lewis back this week from an ankle injury would help the interior of the line.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nJamal Adams made it through his first full game since Week 12 of the 2021 season. And on the surface he appeared to play well. Adams had four tackles, one tackle for loss and one QB hit, and played 85% of the defensive snaps.\n\nHis return in Week 4 from a torn quadriceps tendon that cost him more than a year lasted all of nine plays before suffering a concussion. Sunday was a much more satisfying return.\n\n\"That was the goal. I was just taking it one quarter at a time,\" Adams said. \"Obviously, I was on a little rep count. That was killing me to be on the sideline, but I understood the routine and I understood the plan. I feel great.\"\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nMetcalf continues to have an issue with committing undisciplined penalties. Metcalf was flagged for unnecessary roughness in the second quarter, getting penalized some 30 yards away from where the play took place. Metcalf also had a 15-yard taunting penalty in Week 1 and has five 15-yard penalties for unsportsmanlike conduct, unnecessary roughness or taunting in the past two seasons.\n\nINJURIES\n\nSeattle didn't appear to pick up any significant new injuries coming out of the loss, although the health of the offensive line will be closely watched. The Seahawks don't expect starting right tackle Abraham Lucas to be ready to return this week even though he's eligible to come off injured reserve.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n4 -- Seattle has lost its last four games following its bye week. Last year, it was a 40-34 overtime loss at home to Las Vegas. In 2021, the Seahawks lost 17-0 at Green Bay, and in 2020 it was a 37-34 overtime loss at Arizona. The last time Seattle won out of the bye was 2019 when it beat Philadelphia 17-9.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Seahawks will face an NFC West opponent for the first time since Week 1 when they host Arizona on Sunday. The Seahawks have won three straight in the series, but is just 2-2 in the past four meetings in Seattle.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

        "body": "Don't you just wish that someone would compile all the life hacks you need into one big book which you can refer to anytime? Then again, some people might find it too much of a hassle to take out an actual book and read it!\n\nHere are a few useful tricks that you never knew you needed till now. -- Compiled by PATSY KAM\n\nBanana peels have many uses. -- Filepic\n\n1. If you have silverware that's turned blackish over the years, try cleaning it with a banana peel. Use the inside of the peel to rub your silver item, and then buff it with a clean piece of cloth. Conversely, you could also collect a couple of banana peels and blend them together with a little water so that it forms a paste. Dab a piece of cloth with this and polish your silverware with it. Use a soft clean cloth to buff it so that it shines. This works on lightly tarnished items, and probably not on really blackened silverware.\n\nDon't throw out your orange skin. -- Filepic\n\n2. When you've squeezed your orange and left with the skin, don't throw it out. Cut the orange peel into strips and place them into a jar. Add two tablespoons of baking soda, mix it up and seal it, then keep this in the fridge for a week. Remove the skin and what's left is a natural citrusy detergent that's safe for your hands! You can do this with tangerine or lemon peels too.\n\nKeep your avocado fresh. -- Filepic\n\n3. Don't keep avocado in water. Apparently it's a breeding ground for bacteria. Instead, if you're not using the whole fruit, keep the second half of your avocado face-up in a sealed container, together with some cut red onions! Store this in the fridge and your avocado should still stay nice and green. The onion vapours supposedly keeps the surface from browning. After this, just use both fruit and onion for your savoury dishes. But probably not such a good idea if you're doing desserts. Stick to lemon juice.\n\nMake your own detergent dispenser. -- Photo: PATSY KAM\n\n4. How do you wash your plates? You probably squeeze a few drops of dish detergent into a container and dilute this, then dip your sponge in, yes?\n\nInstead, try pouring a couple drops of detergent into an empty soft drink bottle (500ml or smaller is fine) and fill it up with water. Then, use a sharp object - cake tester needle, safety pin, paper clip or any sharp metal object - heat it up slightly and poke a hole right through the middle of the bottle cap. Close the bottle with the cap and you have a DIY detergent dispenser that you can squeeze directly onto your sponge, which is more efficient as it won't drip everywhere and it saves water.\n\nYogurt can work on meat. -- Filepic\n\n5. If you love yogurt and always have some in the house because you're healthy that way, here's another use for it. Yogurt makes a great natural tenderiser for meat. Just mix a tablespoon or two with the meat (beef or lamb) you're about to cook and set aside for a few hours. Beats using some store-bought chemical tenderiser.\n\nA few rice grains in salt goes a long way. -- Filepic\n\n6. If the salt in your salt shaker tends to clump up, especially towards the bottom half, put in a few grains of rice. Somehow it absorbs the moisture and keeps your salt nice and sprinkly!",

        "body": "Escalating the Middle East conflicts and persisting high inflation in the US are contributing to a more than 2% fall in Thai stocks. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is encountering renewed selling pressure, with the index nearing a crucial resistance level of 1,400 points. Concurrently, gold prices have seen a sharp increase, reaching nearly US$1,950 (70,870 Thai baht) per ounce amidst expectations of increased tensions between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe rise in US inflation is putting additional pressure on the Federal Reserve to either hike interest rates or sustain them at their current high levels for an extended period to curb inflation. This is predicted to change once foreign investors see substantial progress in the government's economic policies, which is expected to provide a boost to equities and the baht.\n\nGlobal stock markets, including Thailand's, have taken a hit in response to fears of external powers being pulled into the Middle East conflict. The SET index ended the morning trading period at 1,420.42 points, a decrease of 30.33 points or 2.09%, with a total transaction value of 32.8 billion Thai baht (US$900 million).\n\nJamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, cautioned that the world could be experiencing its most perilous time in decades due to the war in Ukraine and last week's attack on Israel by Hamas. This is expected to have far-reaching effects on energy and food markets, global trade and geopolitical relationships.\n\nHua Seng Heng, a leader in the gold market, attributed the fluctuation in gold prices to several factors. Among them are market instability, expectations of a recession, banking crisis concerns and escalating geopolitical conflicts including the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict. The global gold market has been on an upward trajectory, reaching US$1,932 (70,220 Thai baht) per ounce, an increase of $63.74 or 3.41%, as the Israel-Hamas conflict intensifies.\n\nHowever, the trend of high interest rates being maintained or increased to control inflation by the Federal Reserve serves as a bearish factor. Crude oil prices are expected to surge above US$100 (3,634 Thai baht) per barrel with the possibility of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, a key channel for the transport of 17.2 million barrels of oil per day, or 20-30% of global consumption. This could have a significant impact on global oil supply, reported Bangkok Post.\n\nIn spite of these challenges, the baht has strengthened as foreign investors have started to buy Thai stocks and gold again. Poon Panichpibool, a strategist at Krungthai Bank, predicted that the baht would range between 36.00-36.30 to the dollar.\n\nInvestors will continue to closely monitor the situation in Israel, according to Asia Plus Securities (ASPS). Rising oil prices due to escalating tensions in the Middle East have positively impacted the energy sector equities. Stocks such as PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP), Thai Oil (TOP) and PTT are recommended.",

        "title": "Injuries for RBs Kyren Williams, Ronnie Rivers put damper on Rams' breakthrough ground game",
        "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rams running backs Kyren Williams and Ronnie Rivers are likely to miss games after getting hurt late in Los Angeles' 26-9 victory over the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nSean McVay gave no specifics or prognoses Monday for Williams, who hurt his ankle in the fourth quarter after rushing for a career-high 158 yards, or backup Rivers, who hurt his knee earlier. But the coach indicated he could be without his top two ball-carriers when the Rams (3-3) host Pittsburgh on Sunday.\n\nWilliams and Rivers \"are going to be out for a little bit,\" McVay said. \"It's tough information for both of those guys, who have done a really good job. ... The initial prognosis looks like it's going to be challenging for those guys in the immediate future.\"\n\nThe Rams, who traded away running back Cam Akers last month, could be relying on rookie Zach Evans or practice squad veteran Royce Freeman in their backfield in the immediate future.\n\nThe injuries put a damper on the good feelings from one of the Rams' most impressive ground performances in recent years.\n\nLos Angeles fell behind 9-6 at halftime after the Cardinals' unorthodox defensive fronts fooled McVay and Matthew Stafford into flexing out of some rushing plays. But after running the ball only three times in the first half, the Rams aggressively committed to the run game after halftime with impressive results.\n\nMcVay, ever ready to criticize himself, absorbed a lesson in trusting his plan.\n\n\"We got talked out of some things that we didn't necessarily need to,\" McVay said of the Rams' hesitant play-calling in the first half. \"I knew we had, what was it, three runs in the first half? So, yes, I was aware of that.\"\n\nAlthough McVay has been calling NFL plays for nearly a decade, the Cardinals threw out some unusual schemes that fooled the youngest coach to win a Super Bowl into some regrettable decisions.\n\n\"However you cut it, it's an excuse,\" McVay said. \"I have to do a better job right from the jump for our guys and put them in some better spots.\"\n\nThe Rams' passing game remained solid with strong play from Stafford and another big game from Cooper Kupp, but Los Angeles appeared to have the ingredients for a balanced offense capable of helping out its deliberately undermanned defense. Stafford believes the Rams can excel by establishing their running game whenever possible.\n\n\"It's not as easy as lining up and just running the ball all the time,\" Stafford said. \"The defenses are going to have their hand in it, and we have to do a good job staying on the field on third down, all those kinds of things.\"\n\nWHAT'S WORKING\n\nThe Rams curiously added only one new starter to the offensive line after the unit struggled with injuries and performed poorly overall last season. Yet the line has been significantly better this season, even in the latest injury absence of Joe Noteboom. After this impressive run-blocking effort against the woeful Cardinals, the line deserves credit as a primary reason the Rams are still at .500.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nKupp's return has minimized Tutu Atwell's role in the offense, and that seems unwise. After catching just two balls a week ago against Philadelphia, the speedy third-year pro turned his only target against Arizona into a 30-yard gem of catch-and-run football. The Rams need Atwell's downfield speed to worry opposing defensive coordinators, but he won't threaten them if Stafford never looks his way.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nEdge rusher Byron Young had the best game yet in his promising rookie season with six tackles, five pressures, one sack and two quarterback hits, according to Pro Football Focus. He also forced the fumble that allowed the Rams essentially to wrap up their victory. LA's defense badly misses edge rusher Leonard Floyd, but Young is becoming a factor.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nPuka Nacua is six games into a record-setting start to his career, but the rookie's hands are not perfect. He dropped what would have been a touchdown pass from Stafford in the first half, although the Cards were called for defensive holding on the play. Nacua had more drops than any receiver in the NFL by some measures over the first five weeks, though that's also a product of being targeted more than any receiver.\n\nINJURIES\n\nAlong with two major injuries at running back, NT Kobie Turner came out of his first career start with a shoulder injury, but McVay didn't know how serious it was. Los Angeles is already thin at nose tackle with Bobby Brown sidelined for several more weeks because of a knee injury.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n49 -- The number of games played by the Rams since a running back put up more yards than Williams' 158 against the Cards. The Notre Dame product was slowed by injuries last year, but he seized a starting role this season with two 100-yard games and seven total touchdowns.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nA visit from Pittsburgh (3-2) is a chance to get above .500 against another opponent roughly on the Rams' level. Aaron Donald will get to face his hometown team for only the third time in his career, and he's 0-2 against the Steelers.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

        "body": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar started Tuesday on the back foot as investors took stock of developments in the Middle East and braced for a slew of speeches by central bank officials this week headlined by Fed Chair Powell to gauge the monetary policy outlook.\n\nThe yen was pinned close to the key 150 per dollar level, keeping traders on edge for any signs of intervention by the Japanese authorities.\n\nThe yen last fetched 149.62 per dollar, having slipped to 150.17 on Oct. 3, the weakest in a year, before getting some relief in a brief rally.\n\nJapan's top financial diplomat Masato Kanda said the yen was still perceived as a safe haven asset like the dollar and the Swiss franc despite its recent weakness, and was benefiting from demand due to the conflict in the Middle East.\n\nIsrael's shekel on Monday breached the key level of four per U.S. dollar for the first time since 2015 on jitters over Israel's war with the Palestinian militant group Hamas. It was last down 1% at 4.0199 per dollar in early Asian hours.\n\n\"Geopolitics will continue to be a key driver for markets in the week ahead as investors continue to weigh the risks of an escalation with the approach of the U.S. authorities to prevent the conflict spreading to rest of the Middle East region,\" said Charu Chanana, market strategist at Saxo in Singapore.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, eased 0.038% to 106.20, after dropping 0.36% on Monday.\n\nInvestor attention will firmly be on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who is due to speak on Thursday, during a busy week of speeches by regional bank heads. Fed officials will enter into a blackout period on Oct. 21 before the Fed's Oct. 31-Nov. 1 meeting.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said on Monday the central bank should not create new pressures in the economy by increasing the cost of borrowing.\n\n\"We should not at this point be thinking about any increases\" in the Fed's rate target, Harker said.\n\nChristopher Wong, currency strategist at OCBC, said the dollar is likely caught in a range for now.\n\n\"Higher for longer (rates), relative U.S. growth resilience and fears of broadening conflict are some of the factors that may underpin support for the dollar,\" Wong said.\n\n\"But less-hawkish Fed speaks suggests the Fed maybe setting the stage for an extended pause. This may mitigate dollar upside.\"\n\nIn other currencies, the euro was down 0.01% at $1.0557, while sterling was last at $1.2214, down 0.02% on the day.\n\nThe Australian dollar rose 0.27% to $0.636. Australia's central bank considered raising rates at its recent policy meeting but judged there was not enough new information to warrant a move, minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's Oct. 3 policy meeting showed.\n\nThe News Zealand dollar eased 0.30% to $0.591 after data on Tuesday showed the nation's consumer inflation hit a two-year low in the second quarter, reducing expectations the central bank will hike the cash rate further in November.\n\n(Reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Singapore; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)",

        "body": "CAIRO, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt issued on Monday sustainable panda bonds in the Chinese financial market in the amount of about 3.5 billion yuan (nearly 479 million U.S. dollars).\n\nIn a statement, Egyptian Finance Minister Mohamed Maait said the issuance has a maturity of three years with a coupon rate of 3.5 percent.\n\nHe explained that the issuance is backed by a credit guarantee provided by international development banks with high credit ratings, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the African Development Bank.\n\nMaait noted that Egypt is the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to issue sustainable panda bonds, adding that it succeeded in attracting many Chinese investors.\n\nThe minister said the issuance serves as a new portal for achieving sustainable development goals, as it facilitates cooperation and the exchange of experience between Egypt and China, building bridges of green and sustainable financing, and encouraging investment as one of the fundamental pillars, which is in line with Egypt Vision 2030, the country's Sustainable Development Strategy.\n\nPanda bonds are yuan-denominated debts sold by overseas issuers to meet financing demand.",

He also announced that Biden would travel to Jordan where he would meet Jordanian King Abdullah II, Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.\n\nBlinken said that the United States also secured assurances from Israel on working to bring foreign assistance into the impoverished and blockaded Gaza Strip as Israel prepares a ground offensive against the Hamas-ruled territory.\n\nUS officials said that a new US coordinator on humanitarian aid, David Satterfield, would work with Israel to develop more concrete plans.\n\nBiden hopes to \"hear from Israel how it will conduct its operations in a way that minimises civilian casualties and enables humanitarian assistance to flow to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not benefit Hama,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"At our request, the United States and Israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from donor nations and multilateral organizations to reach civilians in Gaza,\" Blinken said.\n\nHe said the two sides were discussing the \"possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm's way.\"\n\n\"We welcome the government of Israel's commitment to work on this plan. The president very much looks forward to discussing it further when he's here on Wednesday,\" he said.\n\nBiden has vowed unwavering solidarity with Israel after suffering the worst attack in its 75-year history. But he also has voiced concern about more severe proposals that could impact civilians in Gaza and earlier pressed Israel to reverse a decision to shut off water supply.\n\n\"We share Israel's concern that Hamas may seize or destroy aid going entering Gaza or otherwise preventing it from reaching the people who need it,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"If Hamas in any way blocks humanitarian aid from reaching civilians, including by seizing the aid itself, we'll be the first to condemn it and we will work to prevent it from happening again.\"",

        "body": "Jordan Mason played 15 offensive snaps during the San Francisco 49ers' loss to the Cleveland Browns, while Elijah Mitchell played just seven. Should running back Christian McCaffrey's oblique/rib injury sideline him for the upcoming game against the Vikings, one or both of these players will likely take on more prominent roles.\n\nWhile Mitchell did not grade well in the eyes of Pro Football Focus analysts (69.8 for Mason vs. 56.0 for Mitchell), it is worth noting that Sunday was the fourth-year running back's first game back from a knee injury. Kyle Shanahan isn't dismissing the possibility of Mitchell playing more snaps should McCaffrey be unavailable.\n\n\"I mean, Elijah's earned a ton with us over these years,\" Shanahan told reporters during a Monday afternoon conference call. \"I think Elijah, when he's been healthy, has been as good of a back as there is. He's just had a hard time staying healthy.\n\n\"But I also can't take away anything from JP (Jordan Ponchez Mason). I mean, every time JP's got his opportunities, you guys see how he's done. So both of those guys have done very well.\"\n\nMitchell's reduced playing time was attributed to limited practice reps in the lead-up to Sunday's game. After not practicing on Wednesday, the player was a limited participant during Thursday's and Friday's sessions.\n\n\"Elijah came back and practiced late last week on Thursday, so he got really one true day of practice in, and that's that's why JP got the first nod once Christian came out,\" Shanahan shared. \"But we got two really good players there, and I know Ty [Davis-Price] is waiting for his opportunity also. So hopefully, Christian will be good to go this week, but if not, we got a group of backs that we can rely on.\"",

        "title": "Lions' road to success this season paved with wins away from home",
        "body": "ALLEN PARK, Mich. (AP) -- Dan Campbell doesn't have to think long when asked to compare the Detroit Lions fanbase to others he's seen across the NFL.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this,\" Campbell said Monday after Lions fans turned out at Raymond James Stadium during Sunday's 20-6 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. \"I played in Dallas, and Dallas travels well, but not like this.\n\n\"In the second half, it was so loud when (Tampa Bay)'s offense was out there, I swear I thought they might go to a silent cadence.\"\n\nThe Lions are 3-0 on the road during their 5-1 start, including prime-time Thursday night wins at both Arrowhead Stadium and Lambeau Field -- two of the league's best-known venues.\n\n\"They weren't really road games -- at least they didn't feel like it,\" he said. \"If you want to build a winning team, the first step is being able to win on the road. That's a mindset -- going on the road and it is just you against the other team and their crowd.\n\n\"I think we thrive on that.\"\n\nThe Lions haven't started 3-0 on the road since 2011, when they won in Tampa, Minnesota, Dallas and Denver before a November loss in Chicago.\n\nThat team, coached by Jim Schwartz, was also 5-1 after six weeks, but went 5-5 in its last 10 games. Their 10-6 finish got them a wild-card berth, but they lost 45-28 in New Orleans.\n\nThis season, the fans are hoping to stay home in January -- a division title would see the Lions host a postseason game for the first time since 1993.\n\nWHAT'S WORKING\n\nDetroit's running game stumbled on Sunday after David Montgomery's rib injury, only gaining 41 yards on 21 carries before Jared Goff's kneel-down.\n\nHowever, nothing changed on the other side of the ball. The Lions held the Buccaneers to 46 rushing yards -- the sixth straight time they've held opponents to fewer than 100 yards this season and the third time they've kept the total under 50.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe running game is outstanding when everyone is healthy, but that's not the case at the moment. Rookie Jahmyr Gibbs missed Sunday's game with a hamstring injury, so when Montgomery went out, the Lions were down to Craig Reynolds, who has only scored one touchdown in a five-season career.\n\nReynolds carried the ball 10 times for 15 yards and rookie Devine Ozigbo added three rushes for 5 yards in his NFL debut.\n\n\"Gibbs could be 100 percent by Sunday, but we're comfortable with those two guys,\" Campbell said. \"If we needed a third running back, we've got some guys in the receivers room who can fill in.\"\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nGoff needed to take things to a different level on Sunday.\n\nWith not much of a run game against a tough Buccaneers defense, he completed 30 of 44 passes for 353 yards and two touchdowns without a turnover.\n\nEven with the increased volume -- he came into the game averaging 31.8 attempts -- he had a season-high 11.8 average yards per completion.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nDetroit's pass rush has been spotty. They had seven sacks in a Week 3 win over Atlanta and five more the next week in Green Bay, so the season total looks good, but they only had one in their first two games and two in the past two.\n\nINJURIES\n\nCampbell said that Montgomery has a rib cartilage injury and will probably miss Sunday's game in Baltimore.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\nThree -- the number of turnovers Goff has committed this season. The Lions haven't turned the ball over in the past two games.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nPatch together a running game capable of keeping the Ravens from focusing on Goff in Sunday's game in Baltimore.\n\nAP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

        "body": "SINGAPORE: Almost a decade ago, Sebestian Soh got the idea to buy a shophouse. He had recently returned to Singapore after going to university in London, and to his eyes shophouses had a kind of magic.\n\n\"Everything is new in Singapore except for shophouses, so in a way these are works of art - every shophouse has a different way of expressing itself, a different facade,\" Soh said. \"These are spaces that we can never recreate.\"\n\nBecause he would be investing family money, he needed his father, a seasoned real estate developer, to sign off. The elder Soh was initially unconvinced.\n\nSoh, now 34, studied the market for four years, and eventually his father allowed him to take the plunge in 2018. Since then, he has bought 23 shophouses in quick succession using his family's wealth.\n\nSoh's first purchase has more than doubled in value.\n\nThere are only about 6,500 historic shophouses in Singapore given conservation status. Built during the colonial era from the 1840s to the 1960s, the early ones served merchants and their families with stores at street level and living quarters on the upper floors. As waves of immigrants moved to Singapore, shophouses became cramped, shared dwellings.\n\nBut in an arc familiar to rehabbers of brownstones in New York's Brooklyn and London Victorian terraces, the rows have gone from being thought of as urban relics to high-priced symbols of sophisticated city life.\n\nWith their colourful facades, ornate plasterwork and covered walkways, they are sought after for hipster restaurants, bars and boutique hotels, which are doing brisk post-pandemic business as tourism returns to the city-state.\n\nDemand is also being stoked by Singapore's efforts to regulate housing costs.\n\nThe city-state in April imposed additional levies on locals buying second homes and on foreign buyers purchasing any residential dwellings at all in a bid to cool a red-hot market.\n\nShophouses, the bulk of which are classified as commercial, escape those rules.\n\nLoyalle Chin, a real estate agent who specialises in shophouses, has sold seven commercial ones since late April.\n\n\"Both locals and foreigners have more incentive to channel their assets into commercial real estate,\" he said, because of that exemption.\n\nPrices for shophouses in Singapore have surged to a record S$5,500 per sq ft - double Manhattan's Upper Fifth Avenue, the world's most expensive shopping street in 2022.\n\nSales of shophouses jumped 44%, to S$415mil, in the second quarter from the preceding one, according to property consultants Knight Frank.\n\nMary Sai, executive director of capital markets at Knight Frank Singapore, projects sales to reach as much as S$1.5bil in 2023.\n\nIn the biggest deal in 2023, a Chinese investor paid S$80mil for a row of six shophouses in Boat Quay, a stretch famous for its nightlife. Another river-facing unit in the area sold for S$30mil in May.\n\nSoh gets a weekly unsolicited offer for each shophouse in his family's portfolio. Their rents have also tripled over the past three years.\n\nSoh's first shophouse purchase is now home to his family office. Along Telok Ayer Street in Chinatown, the cyan-blue building adorned with calligraphy frescoes is next to a Michelin-starred restaurant and a few steps away from Thian Hock Keng, the island's oldest Chinese temple.\n\n\"There's tremendous demand,\" Soh said, while brewing tea on the third floor. \"Now we're no longer able to acquire - it's quite hard.\"\n\nThe squeeze has not gone unnoticed by the government.\n\nIn July, it further tightened real estate rules, announcing that foreigners need approval to buy properties that are meant for both commercial and residential use. -- Bloomberg",

        "body": "The governments of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia have received approval from the federal government for their plans to increase the use of renewable energy and stop using coal to generate electricity by 2030.\n\nNew Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston and federal Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson made the announcement during a news conference at the end of a day of meetings in Ottawa on Monday.\n\n\"There's enough agreement today that I'm optimistic that we can get something done that is to the benefit of Nova Scotians and ultimately to the benefit of Canadians,\" Houston told reporters.\n\nThe plans advanced by the two provinces amount to a modified version of the Atlantic Loop, the massive project that would have seen improved transmission lines between the two provinces to allow for the importation of hydroelectric power from Quebec.\n\nNew Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs says both levels of government agree that affordability must be part of the process for greening and upgrading the electricity grid. (CBC)\n\nBut mounting costs -- the latest estimate pegs the project at $9 billion -- and questions about how much energy is actually available from Quebec, led the provinces to pursue a pared-back version of the plan that would still see the creation of upgraded transmission lines, but more focus on renewable energy generated within the two provinces, including wind, solar and nuclear.\n\nAfter months of acrimony between the two levels of government and terse comments shared through letters and news conferences, politicians struck a collaborative and positive tone on Monday, agreeing that the provinces could meet their environmental targets while being conscious of the financial implications for residents.\n\n\"That was a common theme throughout our meeting, that we have to find a way that people can afford to live and work in our respective provinces,\" Higgs told reporters.\n\nInitial funding announced\n\nAs part of Monday's news conference, Wilkinson announced a first phase of funding for the two provinces while talks would continue about broader funding requirements. That includes:\n\nMaking good on the plans will cost much more than that -- Nova Scotia estimates its plan will cost $2 billion -- but Wilkinson said talks are already underway on how Ottawa can help.\n\nNova Scotia Premier Tim Houston speaks to reporters in Ottawa on Monday. (CBC)\n\nWhen talks were focused on the Atlantic Loop, the premiers complained the Ottawa's offer of loans would ultimately drive up power rates to a point that would not be affordable for residents of their respective provinces.\n\nWilkinson said Monday that funding options include some mechanisms that would have been a part of the Atlantic Loop, but the Canada Infrastructure Bank would likely be an option for the transmission lines from Onslow, N.S., to Salsbury, N.B. Investment tax credits would also be an option after they're finalized by the federal government in the coming months.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the grid of the future needs to be one that is clean, but it also needs to be reliable and it also needs to be affordable,\" said Wilkinson.\n\n\"There are other things that we may need to do, but I would say that a lot of the money is actually either in place or it will shortly be to actually have the federal government be a participant in supporting the work that needs to be done.\"",

        "body": "JERUSALEM/GAZA/BEIRUT, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel began evacuating residents in the north on Monday amid escalating conflict with Lebanon's Hezbollah military group in the border area.\n\nThe Israeli-Lebanese border has seen an escalation of tensions since last week as Hezbollah fired tens of rockets at Israeli military sites on Oct. 8 in support of an onslaught by the Gaza-ruling Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nHezbollah on Monday announced that it targeted five Israeli sites with rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns and inflicted Israeli injuries, to which Israel responded by firing seven missiles toward Hezbollah positions in the border town of Rmeish and shelling several Lebanese areas.\n\nIn a statement, the Israeli Defense Ministry told residents of 28 towns living within 2 kilometers of the Israeli-Lebanese border to evacuate, adding that the residents would stay in guesthouses subsidized by the state.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Iran and its backed Hezbollah not to launch a war against Israel. \"We have a message for Iran and Hezbollah: Do not test us in the north. Do not repeat your previous mistake because the price you need to pay will be much higher,\" Netanyahu said at the Knesset, the Israeli parliament.\n\nMeanwhile, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Monday warned that opening a war front in southern Lebanon is \"of no one's interest.\"\n\nOn the same day, Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri called on Arab and Islamic countries to cancel or freeze their normalization agreements with Israel in response to its continuous bombing in Gaza.\n\nHe made the remarks at an online emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to discuss the repercussions of the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nBerri also warned against the plan to \"move Palestinian people from the Gaza Strip to the Sinai Peninsula,\" saying that \"if this plan is implemented, it will not only eliminate the Palestinians but also cause the fall of Arab.\"\n\nWith no sign of abating in sight in the conflict with Israel, militants in Gaza continued to fire rockets at southern Israel throughout the day. In the afternoon, sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The rocket attack disrupted the opening of the winter session of the Knesset. Broadcast video showed lawmakers and other attendees rushing to shelters.\n\nIn Holon, south of Tel Aviv, a 56-year-old woman was moderately injured by shrapnel from the rockets, according to Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service.\n\nThe Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, said in a statement that it fired \"a barrage of rockets\" on Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in response to Israel's \"targeting of civilians.\"\n\nIn heavy Israeli attacks on Gaza, at least 2,808 individuals have been killed and more than 10,850 injured, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.\n\nThe slain Palestinians include at least 11 journalists, the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate said on Monday, adding that more than 20 others were injured as 50 media organizations in Gaza were targeted by Israeli attacks.\n\nAmong the dead in Gaza were also several senior Hamas members, including the regional head of Hamas' intelligence in the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis, the Israeli military said in a statement.\n\nAlso on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed back to Israel after a regional tour, reaffirming in remarks to the media that Israel will \"always have the support of the United States.\"\n\nIn joint statements alongside Blinken, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned that \"a long war\" between Israel and Hamas lies ahead.\n\nSo far, some 1,300 have been killed in Israel by the Hamas-led attacks. The Israeli police said about 615 of the fatalities have been identified.\n\nIn addition, the Israeli military on Monday updated in a statement that at least 199 hostages were held in Gaza, while Hamas claimed that there are 200 to 250 captives in Gaza.",

        "body": "Trump did not explain how he would enforce his demands, including the one requiring immigrants to support Israel's right to exist [Getty]\n\nDonald Trump promised on Monday that if elected president again he will bar immigrants who support Hamas from entering the US and send officers to pro-Hamas protests to arrest and deport immigrants who publicly support the Palestinian armed group.\n\nOn a campaign stop in Iowa, Trump was responding to the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October which led to the Israeli air strikes campaign on the besieged Gaza Strip, which killed over 2,750 Palestinians, including at least 1,000 children.\n\nTrump, president from 2017-2021, said that if elected to a second White House term he would ban entry to the US of anybody who does not believe in Israel's right to exist, and revoke the visas of foreign students who are \"antisemitic\".\n\nHe also vowed to step up travel bans from \"terror-plagued countries\".\n\nHe did not explain how he would enforce his demands, including the one requiring immigrants to support Israel's right to exist under what he called \"strong ideological screening.\"\n\nMany of Trump's immigration policies were challenged in court during his presidency and his newest pledges could also face challenges.\n\nA ban he imposed on immigrants from some Muslim-majority nations was struck down in lower courts but ultimately upheld by the US Supreme Court. Biden ended that ban when he took office.\n\nTrump said on Monday he would ban immigrants from Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen \"or anywhere else that threatens our security\". Trump also read a poem that he used to liken immigrants to deadly snakes.\n\nJaime Harrison, chair of the Democratic National Committee, described Trump's pledges as Islamophobic, extreme and designed to exploit \"fear and anxiety\".\n\nIowa is one of the earliest states to hold a Republican presidential nominating contest.\n\nHe is the frontrunner to win his party's White House nomination and take on Democratic President Joe Biden in the November 2024 election.\n\nPromising to drastically tighten US immigration laws, Trump said: \"If you want to abolish the state of Israel, you're disqualified, if you support Hamas or the ideology behind Hamas, you're disqualified, and if you're a communist, Marxist, or fascist, you are disqualified.\"\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis, one of Trump's Republican rivals for the presidential nomination, said on Monday he favoured the deportation of foreign students who support Hamas and would bar Gaza refugees from the US if elected president.\n\nTrump last week accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being unprepared for the Hamas attacks and called Hezbollah - the Iran-backed Lebanese armed group - \"very smart.\"\n\nHis Iowa remarks appeared to be an effort in part to blunt that criticism.\n\n\"We will aggressively deport resident aliens with jihadist sympathies,\" Trump said.",

        "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Bryce Harper wants to take a swing at the Olympics.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies slugger said it would be a dream to play for Team USA when baseball returns for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Harper, who turned 31 on Monday, has long been an advocate of Major League Baseball taking a break during the season to let major leaguers play in the Olympics.\n\nHarper said his wife texted him a happy birthday message attached to news about baseball's return.\n\n\"You talk about growing the game, and that's the way you grow it at the highest peak,\" Harper said. \"You let guys that are playing in the league take that break just like in the NHL and see what happens. I think it would be really cool. I think it would be a lot of fun. I don't know if they'll ever go for it, but I would love to put USA on my chest and represent it at the highest level.\"\n\nBaseball became an official Olympic sport in 1992 and was initially open only to amateur players. Pros were later permitted, but MLB hasn't let active big leaguers participate. The Olympics scrapped baseball after the 2008 Games, although it was brought back for the 2020 Tokyo Games in baseball-mad Japan. Baseball and softball were left off the Paris 2024 slate.\n\nHarper, a two-time NL MVP, was batting .368 with three homers for the Phillies in the postseason. Harper spoke ahead of Game 1 of the NL Championship Series against Arizona.\n\nHarper signed a 13-year, $330 million contract with the Phillies ahead of the 2019 season. He would be 10 years into the contract and 35 years old, should he get the chance to play for Team USA in LA.\n\n\"I will be old at that point, so I don't know if they're going to want me to be on the team, but it's always a dream,\" Harper said. \"I mean, I think it's everybody's dream to be in the Olympics.\"\n\nHarper had hoped to play for Team USA in spring training at the World Baseball Classic but was recovering from offseason elbow surgery. The WBC is operated by MLB and takes place during spring training, meaning players do not need to miss regular season games to participate.\n\nThe NHL used to pause its regular season to allow players to skate in the Winter Games, but that ended for the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.\n\nCricket, flag football, softball, lacrosse and squash also were confirmed Monday by the International Olympic Committee to be held at the Los Angeles Games.\n\nThe slate of sports cleared a final hurdle from the Olympic body's full membership at a meeting in Mumbai, India, after being proposed by Los Angeles officials one week ago. The slate was recommended by the IOC executive board on Friday.\n\nPhillies manager Rob Thomson, raised in Corunna, Ontario, was part of the Canadian squad that competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles when baseball was a demonstration sport.\n\n\"I think it should be in the Olympics,\" he said. \"My experience was I come from a town of 2,000 people, and I had never played in front of more than 500 people in my life. Our first game was against Venezuela in Dodger Stadium, and there was 45,000 people in the stadium, and I don't even remember the first inning, to tell you the truth. I was just as nervous as you could get.",

        "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Bryce Harper wants to take a swing at the Olympics.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies slugger said it would be a dream to play for Team USA when baseball returns for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Harper, who turned 31 on Monday, has long been an advocate of Major League Baseball taking a break during the season to let major leaguers play in the Olympics.\n\nHarper said his wife texted him a happy birthday message attached to news about baseball's return.\n\n''You talk about growing the game, and that's the way you grow it at the highest peak,'' Harper said. ''You let guys that are playing in the league take that break just like in the NHL and see what happens. I think it would be really cool. I think it would be a lot of fun. I don't know if they'll ever go for it, but I would love to put USA on my chest and represent it at the highest level.''\n\nBaseball became an official Olympic sport in 1992 and was initially open only to amateur players. Pros were later permitted, but MLB hasn't let active big leaguers participate. The Olympics scrapped baseball after the 2008 Games, although it was brought back for the 2020 Tokyo Games in baseball-mad Japan. Baseball and softball were left off the Paris 2024 slate.\n\nHarper, a two-time NL MVP, was batting .368 with three homers for the Phillies in the postseason. Harper spoke ahead of Game 1 of the NL Championship Series against Arizona.\n\nHarper signed a 13-year, $330 million contract with the Phillies ahead of the 2019 season. He would be 10 years into the contract and 35 years old, should he get the chance to play for Team USA in LA.\n\n''I will be old at that point, so I don't know if they're going to want me to be on the team, but it's always a dream,'' Harper said. ''I mean, I think it's everybody's dream to be in the Olympics.''\n\nHarper had hoped to play for Team USA in spring training at the World Baseball Classic but was recovering from offseason elbow surgery. The WBC is operated by MLB and takes place during spring training, meaning players do not need to miss regular season games to participate.\n\nThe NHL used to pause its regular season to allow players to skate in the Winter Games, but that ended for the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.\n\nCricket, flag football, softball, lacrosse and squash also were confirmed Monday by the International Olympic Committee to be held at the Los Angeles Games.\n\nThe slate of sports cleared a final hurdle from the Olympic body's full membership at a meeting in Mumbai, India, after being proposed by Los Angeles officials one week ago. The slate was recommended by the IOC executive board on Friday.\n\nPhillies manager Rob Thomson, raised in Corunna, Ontario, was part of the Canadian squad that competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles when baseball was a demonstration sport.\n\n''I think it should be in the Olympics,'' he said. ''My experience was I come from a town of 2,000 people, and I had never played in front of more than 500 people in my life. Our first game was against Venezuela in Dodger Stadium, and there was 45,000 people in the stadium, and I don't even remember the first inning, to tell you the truth. I was just as nervous as you could get.",

The secret to getting a good result is never just one thing, but the amalgamation of all the things you have prepared.\n\n\"If we manage to keep the ball more than them, we have a better chance of winning the match. There are those who think differently, who don't want us to give them space behind or for us to leave the pitch open.\n\n\"But from what we see across Europe today, those who control the ball more tend to win more often. This is an idea that I agree with.\"\n\nOn a repeat of the 2020 Euro final, Conte added: \"It would be unfair to make comparisons, that final will remain unique. But, we want to be inspired by what happened in that match and maybe make that our identity. We want to confront reality. Reality will tell us what level we are currently at.\"",

        "body": "Anthony Richardson rocketed to the top tier of many NFL Draft boards after a one-of-a-kind performance the pre-draft combine. Shortly after, the Indianapolis Colts tabbed Richardson as the future of the franchise with the No. 4 pick and, in the early going, Richardson's sky-high upside was apparent with his dual-threat abilities on full display. Unfortunately, Richardson was placed on injured reserve with a shoulder injury last week, ensuring he would miss at least four games, and Colts owner Jim Irsay painted a more dire picture on Monday.\n\nIrsay spoke with ESPN's Stephen Holder and revealed that \"the most likelihood is he's probably going to be gone for the year.\" He did stress that the final decision has not been made, but Irsay shared that Richardson \"probably misses this year and we're going to have to contend with that factor.\" Finally, Irsay said there is still a debate happening but the final result is \"probably going to lead toward surgery in the next week or so.\"\n\nObviously, this is a tremendous blow to the Colts, even while acknowledging Indianapolis has one of the best backup quarterbacks in the league in Gardner Minshew. Indianapolis is 3-3 to begin the season, competing valiantly in the AFC South, but even beyond this season, Richardson's health and development is atop the list of important factors surrounding the franchise.\n\nThe 21-year-old Richardson has 577 passing yards and 136 rushing yards while appearing in four games this season. The Colts continue their schedule at home against the Cleveland Browns, led by the NFL's most potent defense, in Week 7.",

        "body": "KINGSLAND, Ga. (AP) -- A man who spent more than 16 years in prison in Florida on a wrongful conviction was shot and killed Monday by a sheriff's deputy in Georgia during a traffic stop, authorities and representatives said.\n\nLeonard Allen Cure, 53, was identified by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which is reviewing the shooting.\n\nHis death was confirmed to the South Florida Sun Sentinel by Seth Miller, executive director of the Innocence Project of Florida, who worked with Cure on his wrongful conviction case.\n\n\"We're devastated by the news of his tragic death, and we don't have any further comment at this time,\" Miller told the newspaper.\n\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigation said a Camden County deputy pulled over a driver along Interstate 95 near the Georgia-Florida line and the driver got out of the car at the deputy's request. He cooperated at first but became violent after he was told he was being arrested, a GBI news release said.\n\nThe agency said preliminary information shows the deputy shocked the driver with a stun gun when he failed to obey commands, and the driver then began assaulting the deputy. The GBI said the deputy again tried using the stun gun and a baton to subdue him, then drew his gun and shot the driver when he continued to resist.\n\nThe agency didn't say what prompted the deputy to pull over Cure's vehicle.\n\nIt is customary for Georgia law enforcement agencies to ask the GBI to investigate shootings involving officers. The agency said it will submit its findings to the district attorney for the coastal Brunswick Judicial Circuit, which includes Camden County.\n\nCure was convicted of the 2003 armed robbery of a drug store in Florida's Dania Beach and sentenced to life in prison because he had previous convictions for robbery and other crimes.\n\nBut the case had issues from the start and his conviction came from a second jury after the first one deadlocked.\n\nIn 2020, the Broward State Attorney's Office new Conviction Review Unit asked a judge to release Cure from prison. Broward's conviction review team said it found \"troubling\" revelations that Cure had solid alibis that were previously disregarded and no physical evidence or solid witnesses to put him at the scene. An independent review panel of five local lawyers concurred with the findings.\n\nCure was released that April after his sentenced was modified. That December, a judge vacated his conviction and sentence.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to putting this situation behind me and moving on with my life,\" Cure told the Sun Sentinel at the time.\n\nIn June, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a claims bill granting Cure $817,000 in compensation for his conviction and imprisonment along with educational benefits.\n\n\"The Leonard we knew was a smart, funny and kind person,\" Broward State Attorney Harold F. Pryor said in a statement to the paper Monday evening. \"After he was freed and exonerated by our office, he visited prosecutors at our office and participated in training to help our staff do their jobs in the fairest and most thorough way possible. He would frequently call to check in on Assistant State Attorney Arielle Demby Berger, the head of the Conviction Review Unit, and offer our team encouragement to continue to do the important work of justice.\"",

Cure became the first man to be exonerated by the Broward Conviction Review Unit.\n\nCure made a petition to CRU head Assistant State Attorney Arielle Demby Berger in 2019, who immediately began examining it, the state attorney's office said in a 2020 news release.\n\nThe CRU's memo released in December 2020 said the only evidence that connected Cure to the robbery was eyewitness identification. Cure had an alibi that placed him at a bank 3.2 miles away from the Walgreens at the time of the robbery, and his boss said he was at work by 8 a.m. that day. The robber fled the store shortly before 7:30 a.m.\n\n\"The issues we find most troublesome are those surrounding how Cure became a suspect in the first place. Seemingly, a man who had no connection to a Walgreens robbery became the main suspect after someone reviewed photos of well-dressed/neat appearing African American males. That was it,\" the CRU's memo said.\n\nCure was released from prison in April 2020 while the investigation continued, and Broward Circuit Judge John J. Murphy III signed an order exonerating him later that year.\n\n\"The Leonard we knew was a smart, funny and kind person,\" Broward State Attorney Harold F. Pryor said in a statement Monday evening. \"After he was freed and exonerated by our office, he visited prosecutors at our office and participated in training to help our staff do their jobs in the fairest and most thorough way possible. He would frequently call to check in on Assistant State Attorney Arielle Demby Berger, the head of the Conviction Review Unit, and offer our team encouragement to continue to do the important work of justice.\"\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis approved a claims bill earlier this year awarding Cure with $817,000 and educational benefits after his exoneration. Cure received his check in early August, Miller said.\n\n\"Leonard was so excited that the Florida Legislature and Gov. Ron DeSantis had recently approved his claims bill. He had been working a job in security, he was hoping to go to college and wanted to work in broadcast radio production, he was buying his first home. We send our sincerest condolences to his family and all who knew him,\" Pryor said.\n\nFlorida state Rep. Michael Gottlieb, who sponsored the claims bill, said Monday in a statement to the Sun Sentinel: \"I met Mr. Cure a few times. I always found him to be a nice, quiet, if not shy and humble, person. He truly felt blessed to be where he was in life and was looking forward to getting an education and putting the false accusations of criminality behind him.\"\n\n\"It's hard to imagine that the person that I met resisted arrest but I don't know (what) the facts are and will wait until further investigation to make any comment about what happened.\"\n\nThe Broward state attorney's office unit reviewed the evidence presented at Cure's trial and the 2003 case found he was most likely innocent of the alleged crime, the state attorney's office said in December 2020.\n\nThe Georgia Innocence Project shared photos of Cure talking to students at Jonesboro High School in Clayton County, Georgia, for \"Wrongful Conviction Day\" a few weeks ago on Facebook.\n\nAfter the investigation, the GBI will forward its findings to the Brunswick Judicial Circuit district attorney's office.\n\n(Information from the South Florida Sun Sentinel archives were included in this report.)\n\n\u00a92023 South Florida Sun-Sentinel.

        "body": "It appears the Boston Red Sox have made significant progress in their search for Chaim Bloom's replacement.\n\nMinnesota Twins general manager Thad Levine has emerged as a strong candidate for Boston's head of baseball operations role, per WEEI's Rob Bradford. The New York Post's Jon Heyman reports Levine is interviewing for the job.\n\nHe wasn't the only name linked to the Red Sox on Monday, however. Bradford reports that former Pittsburgh Pirates GM Neal Huntington is a candidate for the position. Former Red Sox pitcher Craig Breslow, currently in the Chicago Cubs front office after a 12-year MLB career, is also in the mix, per Joel Sherman of The New York Post.\n\nThe Athletic's Chad Jennings' report on Monday added another candidate to the group -- Toronto Blue Jays vice president of baseball strategy James Click -- while removing three others. Los Angeles Dodgers GM Brandon Gomes, Philadelphia Phillies GM Sam Fuld, and Twins president of baseball operations Derek Falvey each reportedly declined interviews for the Red Sox job. Fuld had been rumored to be one of the \"leading candidates\" to replace Bloom.\n\nJennings adds that it's uncertain whether the Red Sox plan to pursue Kim Ng, who stepped down from her role as Miami Marlins GM on Monday. Red Sox assistant GM Eddie Romero is considered the favorite among internal candidates. And as for Levine, it's \"no slam dunk\" that the two sides are a match.\n\nWith so many names floating around, it can be difficult to keep up with the Red Sox' ongoing search for a Bloom replacement. So to recap, here are the candidates and the names that have been ruled out, per reports.",

        "title": "Slavery reparations in Amherst could include funding for youth programs and housing",
        "body": "BOSTON (AP) -- A Massachusetts college town that established one of the nation's first reparation funds for Black residents is considering spending the proceeds of the $2 million endowment on youth programs, affordable housing and grants for businesses.\n\nThe Amherst Town Council established the reparation fund two years ago, inspired by nationwide protests against the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers, to atone for slavery, discrimination and past wrongs.\n\nThe council Monday night will consider a report from the town's African Heritage Reparation Assembly on how those funds should be spent.\n\nThe amount of funding would be equivalent to the annual tax revenue the town raises from cannabis sales, which is projected to be about $200,000 a year. The plan has been to grow the fund over a decade and then sustainably donate as much as $100,000 a year in the town, which is about 6% Black.\n\nThe assembly, which was appointed by the town manager, now wants the town to consider accelerating the timeline, perhaps by borrowing from reserves to allocate the money immediately, dedicating $100,000 from cannabis tax revenue to be spent on reparations annually, or aiming to reach the $2 million goal in four years, rather than 10.\n\n\"The recommendations we've made will begin to make this space one that is more inviting, welcoming and hospitable for people of African descent,\" said Amilcar Shabazz, a professor in the W.E.B. Du Bois Department of Afro-American Studies, University of Massachusetts, who has written a book on reparations and is a member of the assembly.\n\n\"I believe this project that we have embarked upon will contribute to the national momentum toward Black reparations, the kind of reparations that will meaningfully change the status of African Americans in this country,\" Shabazz said.\n\nThe report lays out a case for reparations, including that Black residents were enslaved in the 17th and 18th centuries in Amherst, a city of 40,000 that is home to Amherst College and University of Massachusetts Amherst. The report cites a document from 1754-55 showing that 18 residents of Amherst and nearby Hadley were enslaved and that a doctor treated enslaved people.\n\nThe 160-page report also found that Amherst College benefited from wealth generated through slavery and that Black residents into the 20th century were excluded from hotels, restaurants, barbershops and Amherst College fraternities. It cites restrictive housing policies preventing Black families from purchasing homes in desirable parts of town and other structural racism that shut them out of jobs and educational opportunities.\n\nAmherst is among hundreds of American communities and organizations seeking to provide reparations to Black people, from the state of California to cities such as Providence, Rhode Island, religious denominations including the Episcopal Church and prominent colleges such as Georgetown University.\n\nAmherst advocates have cited Evanston, Illinois, which became the first American city to pay reparations last month, as a model. That program uses marijuana tax revenues to give eligible Black residents $25,000 housing grants for downpayments, repairs or existing mortgages.\n\nEarlier this year, a reparations task force in California handed lawmakers a report with more than 100 recommendations. That 1,100-page report details California's role in perpetuating discrimination against Black residents. Ideas for repairing the harm range from formally apologizing to paying descendants of enslaved people for having suffered under discriminatory policing and housing policies.\n\nLast year, Boston created a task force to study how it can provide reparations for and other forms of atonement to Black Bostonians for the city's role in slavery and its legacy of inequality.\n\nAlong with spending funds on programs, the Amherst report is calling for special state legislation that would allow the town to provide direct cash payments to eligible Black residents who have experienced racism. The report didn't say how many residents would be eligible or how large those payments would be.\n\nTown councilor Michele Miller chairs the assembly, whose six other members identify as Black. She acknowledged that some residents have challenged the idea of giving city revenue directly to descendants, but said the members feel it should be explored. If not direct payments, another option might be providing eligible residents with downpayments for a home, she said.\n\n\"There are cases, as we've indicated in our report, where direct cash benefits are necessary and where they will make a difference in terms of reparative justice,\" Miller said.",

        "body": "During a conference call with reporters on Monday, San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan provided updates on the injuries sustained during Sunday's loss to the Cleveland Browns.\n\nRunning back Christian McCaffrey suffered an oblique/rib injury in the third quarter. Although he briefly returned to the game, he was again sidelined after just one play.\n\nShanahan didn't have an update on McCaffrey, who was undergoing his MRI as the coach spoke with reporters. The 49ers are awaiting the results.\n\nThe coach was asked if McCaffrey could play with some added protection under his jersey, as the 49ers did with quarterback Brock Purdy's rib injury last season.\n\n\"It's obviously a tougher position just because you get hit a lot more, but we just got to see how it reacts,\" Shanahan responded. \"We got to see exactly what's wrong with it, too, because we haven't got that back yet. So we say oblique/rib. Hopefully, it's not both, but we got to wait to see for sure.\"\n\nThe good news is that the rest of the injured players are day-to-day, meaning there is nothing significant there.\n\nDeebo Samuel sustained a shoulder injury late in the first quarter. While X-rays showed no immediate concerns, the receiver underwent an MRI to assess the extent of the injury. The coach didn't provide additional details about the injury, simply noting that the receiver is day-to-day.\n\n\"We got to see how it recovers this week, and it's just how his body is going to handle it,\" Shanahan said. \"You never know how those react. So we'll wait and see.\"\n\nLate in the first quarter, tackle Trent Williams suffered an ankle injury. Despite the discomfort, he managed to return to the game and played through the pain.\n\n\"It didn't feel good at all,\" Williams said after the 19-17 loss. \"It's football, and I just tried to fight through it for my teammates.\"\n\nShanahan added that Williams' injury is not a high-ankle sprain. The coach was asked about the difficult decision of allowing a player to play through an injury.\n\n\"That's always the toughest thing because you never want to do something to put someone at a huge jeopardy to make it worse,\" Shanahan responded. \"And that's why you got to go with the player. Hopefully, you have an idea. Well, first of all, you've got to ask the trainers. But then you go to the player, and you've got to have a history with the player. You've got to kind of know how he is and stuff like that.\n\n\"And I truly believe that if Trent couldn't go, Trent's not going to go. He's going to do everything he can to be out there, but Trent's a very intelligent guy who is also very competitive and understands what those decisions are. And he said he could come back. I wasn't expecting him [to] because of how bad the injury looked.\n\n\"The trainers thought that it wasn't as serious as it looked. Trent was adamant to get back out there, and then we keep our eyes on him all game, which [offensive line/run game coordinator] Chris Foerster does a real good job of. So does [James Cregg] and Joe [Graves], his assistants.\n\n\"And Trent, we thought, battled during the game, didn't show any limps, and it was a pretty courageous effort by him coming out in those circumstances, especially the player he was going against (Myles Garrett).\"\n\nSafety George Odum is dealing with a quad contusion.\n\nDre Greenlaw did not play against the Browns due to a hamstring injury. Shanahan noted that the 49ers expect to get their star linebacker back for practice this week, which begins on Thursday due to San Francisco's next game being on Monday night.",

        "body": "We'll do everything possible to support Akosombo Dam spillage victims - Akufo-Addo\n\nCitiFm\n\nMon 16th Oct, 2023 17:58\n\nPresident Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo says the government will do everything possible to ensure the needed help reaches victims of flooding in parts of the Eastern, Greater Accra, and Volta regions as a result of the spillage of excess water from the Kpong and Akosombo Dams.\n\nAkufo-Addo gave the assurance when he visited the residents of Mepe and surrounding areas on Monday to ascertain the devastation caused by the spillage.\n\nPresident Akufo-Addo indicated that the inter-ministerial committee he commissioned to tackle issues pertaining to the flooding is to decide the immediate relief to be provided to the victims and also to ensure such a disaster of greater proportion does not happen in the future.\n\n\"The coordination is about the immediate and the most important thing was to ensure the life of people and that is why 9 centres were established for all the displaced people and all the people in these 9 centres have been provided relief items by NADMO, and it is NADMO's intention to continue to provide relief items. Apart from what NADMO is doing, we must also think about the future.\n\n\"I am aware that you are a farming people and the people who are farming on the banks of the rivers and had their crops destroyed, one of the things the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance and the Office of the President are going to do is to work together with the district assemblies to decide the exact support we have to give to you when the water has gone away.\"\n\n\"And this is why I am saying that the Committee is working in several phases, one being to provide immediate relief, and then to prevent such happening in the future and I want you to know the government is going to do everything in its powers to assist to ensure everything is all right.\"\n\n\"Let everybody know that politics does not come into the issue when things like this occur and government acts. When I took the oath I took it on behalf of everyone in Ghana. And whether they voted for me or not, I'm the president of the people.\"\n\nThe VRA commenced the controlled water spillage from the Akosombo and Kpong Dams on September 15, 2023, due to a consistent rise in the inflow pattern and water level of the Akosombo reservoir.\n\nThousands of residents in South Tongu, North Tongu, Central Tongu, Asuogyaman, and several other residents have had their homes submerged due to the spillage.\n\nThe post We'll do everything possible to support Akosombo Dam spillage victims - Akufo-Addo appeared first on Citinewsroom - Comprehensive News in Ghana.\n\nRead Full Story\n\nAdvertise Here contact ads[@]ghheadlines.com",

        "body": "ChosenCon drew thousands to the Hilton Anatole for a mix of entertainment and prayer.\n\nBible-based TV show The Chosen brought about 3,500 to Dallas for a fan convention last weekend that mixed typical cast meet-and-greets and Q&As with Sunday morning worship.\n\nThe Hilton Anatole hotel was full of fans in teal The Chosen T-shirts and first-century style costumes, including at least one Roman centurion's uniform and plenty of floor-length tunics and veils.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChosenCon's schedule featured a sermon on a story that appears in both the Bible and the show, a Q&A where creator Dallas Jenkins defended The Chosen against the criticisms of some purists who say it's adding to Scripture, and a Family Feud-style game show with some friendly Christian trash-talking. Forget your usual put-downs: The meanest it got here was the zinger \"I thought Thaddeus was the meek!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe convention ended with a surprise on Sunday night, as Jenkins announced that the show's full upcoming fourth season would be released exclusively in theaters starting Feb. 1 before landing on streaming. Fans also got an early look at two trailers for season 4. The first was released online Monday.\n\nBreaking News\n\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\n\nEmail Address\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nSUBMITPhotos: ChosenCon hosted its first fan convention in Dallas 13 imagesView Gallery\n\nThe Chosen kicked off its first season in 2019 after a crowdfunding effort and has become a success even without backing from a Hollywood studio or a well-known creator or star at the outset. By its own count, the series has garnered over 600 million episode views. It can be watched for free on The Chosen app, and some seasons are available on platforms like Netflix and Prime Video.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany attendees at ChosenCon flew in just for the weekend, and some were superfans who had been extras in multiple seasons of the show. The Chosen is known for its close relationship with fans; for a scene in season 3 where Jesus feeds over 5,000 people, thousands traveled to Midlothian to be extras.\n\nJudith Stoneburner, who traveled from Michigan to attend ChosenCon, was among the superfans who appeared in the scene. Stoneburner attended the convention with her daughter Sakara, 10, and wore a piece of the costume she used as an extra.\n\nStoneburner planned to connect with fellow extras. \"This is more of a family reunion than a 'con,'\" she explained, adding that it was her first time at a fan convention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKatherine Menning, who flew from Minnesota, felt the same way about the community surrounding the show. \"I've made more friends than I can count through being an extra, through being a fan,\" she said. She explained that the show had reached out to her with a free ticket to the convention so she could participate in one of the trivia events.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn gushing over the series, its biggest fans zeroed in on a particular element: its focus on Jesus as a human, evident in scenes of him doing ordinary things like brushing his teeth or blowing raspberries.\n\n\"Growing up, my depiction of Jesus was always up in the clouds, or very stoic, very holier than thou,\" Menning explained. \"So when I see Jesus doing these human things that I do every day, it just made him more relatable and [made me] see him in a different light that drew me closer to him and made me love him even more.\"\n\nAidan McCard, who traveled to ChosenCon from South Carolina, said The Chosen made him feel more connected with his faith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe college sophomore started watching the show after a recommendation from a high school Bible study leader. \"Right as I started watching the show was when I really started finding my place with Jesus,\" he said. \"Throughout my whole walk with him, more than anything I've seen him as my best friend. I think a lot of that is because of being able to see his human side through an actual human portrayal.\"\n\nJoy Ashford covers faith and religion in North Texas for The Dallas Morning News through a partnership with Report for America.",

He came all the way from Chapel Hill to debut his start-up Artemis Immersive, which uses spatial technology to help doctors better treat their patients.\n\n\"It's just an opportunity you are not going to get anywhere else,\" he said.\n\nThe event is the brain child of Innovate Orlando, a nonprofit aimed at driving the technology and innovation strategy in Central Florida.\n\nAs CEO of Innovate Orlando, David Adelson said he believes the new event -- which combines Synapse Orlando and Immerse Global Summit -- will put a spotlight on what the Orlando area has to offer the tech space.\n\n\"We have our heavy hitters like Meta and Google and Amazon and Sony that we know as those global iconic brands, but they are all coming here to Orlando to also see our regional players,\" said Adelson.\n\nHe said about half of the exhibitors will be local and have the chance to put themselves on a global stage from their own backyard.\n\nWith more than 2,000 people participating, Adelson said he believes the impacts will be felt citywide.\n\n\"We are expecting several millions of dollars, and that is awesome for the City Beautiful, especially this the first year,\" he said. \"As we continue to grow this will just get bigger and bigger and bigger.\"\n\nAdelson was confident the event will allow more people see how much of a tech hub Central Florida has become.\n\n\"I would suspect that after they see the talent that we have ... and the companies that are emerging here, they are going to look at Orlando much differently than they ever have before,\" said Adelson.\n\nAs for Isley, Orlando made such an impact on him already that he's now thinking about bringing his business here.\n\n\"Obviously there is a lot of amazing innovation happening in certain areas of the world, but I don't think that I have ever seen anything like it is here,\" she said.",

        "body": "HOUSTON -- Houston slugger Yordan Alvarez is dealing with an ailment as the Astros face the Texas Rangers in the AL Championship Series, a person familiar with his condition told The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the illness publicly.\n\nManager Dusty Baker deflected when asked about Alvarez's health prior to Game 2.\n\n''He's fine,'' Baker said. ''He's better today than he was yesterday.''\n\nServing as the designated hitter, Alvarez homered in his first at-bat on Monday. He drove a fastball from Nathan Eovaldi into the seats in right field to cut Houston's deficit to 4-1 in the second inning.\n\nAlvarez's illness was first reported by The Athletic.\n\nAlvarez was not on the field for introductions or the national anthem before Game 1 on Sunday night. Alvarez, who hit .438 with four homers and six RBIs in the Division Series, had an uncharacteristically poor game in the 2-0 loss, going 0 for 4 with three strikeouts.\n\nBaker added that people often have to work when they aren't feeling well.\n\n''Like I was telling somebody yesterday, as a responsible man, a family man, you go to work, you know,'' the 74-year-old manager said. ''And I never saw my dad in the bed ever sick, and I'm sure he was sick. And sometimes as a man you just go to work.''",

        "body": "The Johnny Jet Editorial team writes about airline miles, travel credit card reviews, and travel news for Johnny Jet.\n\nThis post contains references to products from one or more of our advertisers. We may receive compensation when you click on links to those products. For an explanation of our Advertising Disclosure, visit this page.\n\nEverybody loves the opportunity to travel for free. Occasionally, airlines offer great deals on flying with your partner or best buddy via a flight pass. Alaska Airlines, for example, offers an annual $99 companion fare linked to their Alaska Airlines Visa Signature Card. The Southwest Companion Pass\u00ae, however, is even more valuable. Want to know more about how to earn and redeem the Southwest Companion Pass\u00ae? We'll tell you how you can get a Southwest Companion Pass?\n\nSouthwest Companion Pass\u00ae, unlike some other companion fares, is totally free. Well, almost totally free. Taxes and fees must still be accounted for, but those start at only $5.60 for a one-way ticket. That means no flat-rate companion fares or shelling out an annual fee to take advantage of the privilege.\n\nWhat could make a free flight even better? Unlimited free flights for over a year, that's what. The Southwest Companion Pass doesn't only allow one free flight for your travel buddy, but as many flights as you like in the time period that it is valid. Once you earn the standard Companion Pass, it is valid for one whole calendar year (January-December) after you meet the requirements plus the remainder of the calendar year in which you earned it.\n\nThat means if you earn the standard pass in May, you can use it for the rest of this year plus all of next year. But it gets better: you can redeem the pass whether you're paying for your own flight in cash or in miles. So you can potentially rack up all the miles you need for a companion pass, then redeem them for upwards of 10 one-way flights and only pay taxes and fees for your travel and your companion's.\n\nSo what's the catch? In order to earn the standard Southwest Companion Pass, you have to meet a few requirements. The most difficult of which is to fly 100 times in a calendar year. That may seem impossible for anyone who doesn't travel for business multiple times a month, but fortunately, there's another way to earn.\n\nYou can also claim the Southwest Companion Pass by making 100 one-way qualifying flights (or 50 round-trip qualifying flights) or 135,000 qualifying points.\n\nNew Southwest Airlines (consumer) credit cardholders can earn 50,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.\n\nThe consumer cards that have this bonus offer include the following:\n\nSouthwest consumer cardholders earn unlimited:\n\nAdditionally, all three consumer cards come with 25% back on inflight purchases.\n\nFor even more points, sign up for the Southwest\u00ae Rapid Rewards\u00ae Premier Business Credit Card.\n\nAlternatively, you can sign up for the Southwest\u00ae Rapid Rewards\u00ae Performance Business Credit Card. New card members can earn 80,000 bonus points after spending $5,000 on purchases in the first 3 months of account opening.\n\nThe Southwest\u00ae Rapid Rewards\u00ae Performance Business Credit Card earns:\n\nCardholders also get unlimited tier qualifying points (TQPs) that can be earned toward A-List status. There is also a $500 annual fee credit for Rapid Rewards points transfers.\n\nIt also comes with 4 upgraded boardings per year (when available) and Global Entry or TSA PreCheck fee credit.\n\nUse the cards for all your spending and the points will start adding up.\n\nYou can also earn points from any flights you take with Southwest. Keep in mind that they award miles based on your fare, not the distance traveled, so more expensive Business Select fares will mean more miles in your account.\n\nSouthwest Airlines' travel partners are also an easy way to earn, though not all of them are eligible. For example, the points you collect from the Southwest shopping and dining portals count toward the 135,000 points, but transfers from Ultimate Rewards (if you also have a Chase Sapphire Card) don't.\n\nPurchased points, points transferred between members, points converted from hotel and car loyalty programs, and e-Rewards, e-Miles, Valued Opinions, and Diners Club points don't count. Points earned from program enrollment, Tier bonuses, flight bonus points, and partner bonus points do not qualify as Southwest Companion Pass\u00ae qualifying points.\n\nOnce you've earned the pass, the question becomes, how do you redeem it? First, you must log in to your Rapid Rewards account and designate an individual as your companion. They will get a special Companion Pass card. You can even change who your designated companion is up to three times per calendar year if necessary.\n\nAfter you've designated your companion, you must book your flight first. Then go to the My Trips page in your account, find your flights, and select Add Companion. Review the flight information and click Purchase to complete the reservation. That's all there is to it! Remember, you can pay in cash or points for the initial member fare.\n\nYou both have to be booked on the same flight on the same day. Any changes made to your purchased ticket will also have to be made to the Companion Pass. That includes upgrades.",
